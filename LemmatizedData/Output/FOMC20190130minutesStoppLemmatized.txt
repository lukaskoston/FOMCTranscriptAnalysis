January meeting , staff provide briefing effectiveness efficiency Committeeâs current
operating regime option transition

staff note Committee previously indicate that , longer run , intend operate
security holding necessary implement
monetary policy efficiently effectively . consider effectiveness operating regime , staff
observe recent year , Federal Reserve
able implement monetary policy environment ample reserve adjust administer
ratesâincluding rate require excess reserve

Participants note key advantage
Federal Reserveâs current operating regime , include
good control policy rate variety condition
good transmission money market rate
broader financial market . observe regime

period crisis , stabilize
policy rate environment would require large
frequent open market operation . Participants judged
that , light extensive previous discussion ,
appropriate provide public
certainty Federal Reserve would continue use
current operating regime . Choosing operating regime would also allow Committee move forward
related issue , include plan conclude normalization size balance sheet . Participants
emphasize importance describe chosen
operating regime clear term enhance public understanding .
Participants discuss market commentary suggest process balance sheet normalization
might influence financial market . Participants
note ongoing reduction Federal Reserveâs asset holding proceed smoothly
year , significant effect financial market . gradual reduction security holding
announce well advance and , intend ,

proceed largely background , federal
fund rate remain Committeeâs primary tool
adjust stance policy . Nonetheless , investor might interpret previous communication
indicate high threshold would
met Committee would willing adjust
balance sheet normalization plan . Participants observe that , although target range federal
fund rate Committeeâs primary mean adjust stance policy , balance sheet normalization process proceed way support
achievement Federal Reserveâs dual-mandate
goal maximum employment stable price . Consistent principle , participant agree
important flexible manage process balance sheet normalization , would appropriate adjust detail balance sheet normalization
plan light economic financial development
necessary achieve Committeeâs macroeconomic
objective .
Almost participant thought would desirable
announce long plan stop reduce
Federal Reserveâs asset holding later year .
announcement would provide certainty
process complete normalization size
Federal Reserveâs balance sheet . substantial majority expect asset redemption end ,
level reserve would likely somewhat large
necessary efficient effective implementation
monetary policy ; so , many suggest
gradual decline average level reserve , reflect trend growth liability Federal Reserve note circulation , could appropriate .
participantsâ view , process would allow
Federal Reserve arrive slowly efficient level
reserve maintain good control short-term
interest rate without need engage frequent open market operation . participant
judged would little benefit allow reserve continue fall end redemption
approach could cost , undue
risk volatility short-term interest rate , would
exceed benefit . participant thought
upon end asset redemption , Federal Reserve
begin add asset offset growth nonreserve liability , keep average level reserve relatively stable . couple participant suggest ceiling facility mitigate temporary unexpected pressure reserve market could play useful
role support policy implementation low level
reserve .
