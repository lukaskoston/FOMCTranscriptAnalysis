Many participant note market expectation

sizable change forward guidance could
disturb alignment . Nonetheless , participant generally saw Committeeâs upcoming meeting
opportune occasion reformulation guidance

reformulation could accompany statement
new language intend consistent
current market expectation . participant
stress Committee several vehicle ,
include Chairâs postmeeting press conference ,

Participants agree exist forward guidance ,
reference 6Â½ percent threshold

threshold useful communicate policy intention employment far mandate-consistent level , but , economy
move appreciably closer maximum employment ,
forward guidance emphasize Committee focus broader set economic

Participants put forward number suggestion

one possible reason effective low bound federal fund rate limit
Committeeâs scope provide accommodation response adverse shock . contrast , participant express preference quantitative guidance .
participant saw merit state explicitly
Committee would provide accommodation
extent necessary prevent inflation run persistently 2 percent longer-run goal . One
participant argue forward guidance
would strengthen credibility Committeeâs
inflation objective well encourage employment
outcome consistent Committeeâs objective maximum employment . Another participant suggest Committee state
would adjust policy keep project inflation
near 2 percent medium term , would
balance deviation objective near term .
Still another participant express preference state explicit quantitative criterion labor market

participant favor provide information

likely behavior federal fund rate

future Committee need provide

Committee participant also consider whether revise forward guidance include prominent mention financial development potential

Committeeâs monitoring financial condition
risk financial stability already well understood market that , reference
financial development might usefully include
