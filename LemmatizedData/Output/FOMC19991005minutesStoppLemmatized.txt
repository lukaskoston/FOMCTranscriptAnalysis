somewhat high core inflation .
review development across nation , member report continued high
level activity region indication moderate growth , though
agriculture remain relatively depressed many area . anecdotal information
around nation clearly support overall statistical evidence persist

light motor vehicle , continue rise brisk pace . strength

Committee-s discussion outlook inflation , number member
emphasize behavior price remain surprisingly benign

historical record exceed economy-s sustainable capacity -- perhaps even
present , give evident strength aggregate demand . outcome
seem likely generate pressure unit labor cost , tend
recent year contain accelerate productivity . evidence
acceleration come end , member saw clear risk upward
pressure labor cost could point outpace gain productivity . Members
also mention labor compensation would come great pressure
result rise healthcare benefit cost possible increase minimum wage .

could move future , secondary effect earlier increase cost
price sector economy seem likely . Nonetheless , considerable
uncertainty surround expectation rise inflation . Labor cost increase
turn core inflation continued edge low . improvement
productivity growth could keep price pressure check time .

In Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead ,
member indicate favor could accept unchanged policy stance .
Members comment saw little risk surge inflation come
month , though pickup currently subdue level core price inflation
distinct possibility prospective economic condition . note
expand aggregate supply , boost accelerate productivity , remain
reasonable balance rapidly grow aggregate demand despite already high
level economic activity ; however , substantial uncertainty surround outlook
aggregate supply aggregate demand go forward unclear
interaction would affect behavior inflation . light uncertainty
surround development , member agree would desirable
await evidence performance economy , regard
considerable new information behavior economy outlook
inflation would become available intermeeting period . risk wait
seem small juncture , part inflation inflation expectation
likely worsen substantially near term , Committee
demonstrate willingness take need anticipatory action curb rise
inflationary pressure could threaten overall performance economy .
also agree century date change concern likely kind
magnitude would preclude policy tighten move November meeting ,
action seem warrant time .
issue tilt Committee-s directive , majority member
favor associate unchanged policy stance directive bias
toward restraint . member anticipate intermeeting development
would require policy tighten week immediately ahead ,
believe Committee probably would need move less accommodative
policy stance relatively near future , possibly November meeting .
also believe that , give Committee-s recently adopt practice immediately
announce decision change symmetry directive , asymmetrical
directive would help convey message policy adjustment might yet
complete balance year Committee remain concerned
potential inflationary development come month . member ,
generally agree risk point balance rise inflation
time , nonetheless quite uncertain timing additional firm
monetary policy prefer leave Committee-s possible future course
action open . Even so , could accept asymmetric directive light
consensus emerge meeting favor unchanged policy stance .
regard Committee-s announcement decision adopt asymmetric
directive , member observe recent practice make announcement
lead misinterpretation Committee-s intention seem
add volatility financial market . consequence , Committee member
briefly consider alternative treatment symmetry disclosure
meeting . Committee begin process examine word
directive announcement policy , member conclude
satisfactory alternative now , though fully satisfactory ,

continue Committee-s recent announcement practice . However , work
