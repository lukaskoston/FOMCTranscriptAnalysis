Messrs . Evans Kashkari dissent prefer maintain exist target range federal fund rate meeting .
Mr . Evansâs view , inflation continue run
substantially 2 percent measure inflation
expectation low believe consistent
symmetric 2 percent inflation objective , important pause process policy normalization .
Leaving target range 1 1Â¼ percent time
would well support increase inflation expectation , increase likelihood inflation rise
2 percent perhaps modestly beyond , thus provide support symmetry Committeeâs
inflation objective . pause also would well allow
Committee time ass degree earlier
soft reading inflation transitory persistent .
Mr . Kashkariâs view , employment growth remain strong , wage growth picked inflation remain notably Committeeâs 2 percent target . addition , yield curve flatten
long-term rate move high even though
Committee raise federal fund rate target range .
concerned flatten yield curve partly

assessment appropriate monetary policyâincluding path federal fund rate longer-run
valueâand assumption factor likely affect economic outcome . longer-run projection

expect that , appropriate monetary policy ,
growth real GDP 2018 would somewhat
strong individual estimate longer-run
rate . participant project real GDP growth
would moderate 2019 , nearly predict
would ease 2020 ; solid majority participant thought growth real GDP would
close individual estimate economyâs
longer-run growth rate 2020 . participant
submit longer-run projection expect unemployment rate would run estimate

federal fund rate projection 2018 2019 ,
several others lower projection , leave median projection federal fund rate year
unchanged ; median projection 2020 slightly
high , median projection longer-run
