discussion current condition economic outlook , many participant
say circumstance change anticipate time
Committee-s meeting early February . particular , incoming data anecdotal
information indicate economic activity appreciably forward
momentum previously perceive inflation pressure could
intensifying . underlie inflation appear move modestly
nearly participant thought core total inflation go forward would
relatively low , become less certain outlook next
quarter .

Many participant note recent data business commentary
indicate investment run considerably strong first quarter
year previously anticipate . Underlying trend capital spending
appear robust earlier recognize , perhaps partly
response unusually supportive financial condition , strength thought
likely carry forward . Business contact confident economic
prospect , confidence bolster firms- willingness invest . Anecdotal
information suggest firm invest part expand capacity
part boost productivity low cost . investment prompt
need replace equipment become obsolete , part
high level energy price . Increased demand report wide variety
category capital good , range several type heavy equipment , include
truck , farm machinery , construction equipment , software high-tech
equipment . Nonresidential construction , however , remain soft many region ,
damped relatively high vacancy rate office building commercial
real estate .
Spending housing consumer good service also see
underpin economic expansion . single-family housing start record level ,
residential investment expenditure apparently continued spur relatively
low interest rate . participant cite evidence speculative activity
housing market several region . However , recent house price development
mixed , report incipient softness market , include high-end
property , overall house price inflation see likely slow come
quarter . Consumer expenditure expect continue advance solid
pace , buoyed strong gain personal income , although high energy price could
exert restraint spending . possibility appreciable rise
personal save rate , near historical low , represent another possible
downside risk consumer spending . recent sharp slow motor vehicle sale ,
appear related part par purchase incentive perhaps
also high level energy price , raise concern expansion
economic activity region .
participant mention expansion abroad apparently strengthen
early year , particularly emerging-market economy . development ,
turn , likely help support U.S . export . Several participant note past
decline foreign exchange value dollar contribute U.S .
economic activity . Tourism abroad , example , spur relative
currency value . time , though , recognize growth U.S .
domestic demand would likely continue met part import , tend trim
increase domestic output .
U.S . industrial activity increase steadily , push capacity utilization high .
Production expand broad range manufacturing category , notably
include high-tech defense industry . Business contact indicate high
level energy price spur coal mining activity . Drilling oil gas
also increase , although extraction say crimped instance

scarcity experienced rig hand well spot shortage certain key production
input , drilling pipe .
Around nation , labor market condition report stable improving ,
meeting participant perceive slack labor market gradually
diminishing . general , business executive indicate labor readily available ,
although worker certain skill certain occupation ,
trucking , become increasingly difficult hire . comment
failure labor force participation rise expect expansion gain
momentum likely portend somewhat weaker labor force growth previously
anticipate ; development , margin , would tend reduce expansion
potential output . Still , pressure price stem labor cost seem well
contain expect remain damped come quarter . National data
anecdotal information suggest wage generally continued increase
moderately . However , health-care expense persistent source pressure
cost .
Growth unit labor cost continued held growth output per
hour work , continued perform surprisingly well . Although
productivity growth slow extraordinarily rapid pace prevail
earlier expansion , data fourth quarter 2004 , well preliminary
indication first quarter year , suggest gain efficiency
remain substantial . Participants remark many business executive
seek advance productivity organizational improvement
well investment equipment software . Regarding latter ,
evidence suggest rapid technological progress sustain ,
would continue drive cost many form productive capital thus
boost return investment . Moreover , strong picture capital spending
emerge late bode well performance productivity go forward .
Still , considerable uncertainty persist longer-run prospect productivity
growth , unit labor cost , cost pressure profit price .
Meeting participant comment particular detail inflation situation .
note concern recent elevate reading inflation price core
personal consumption expenditure , producer price index , indicator
price earlier stage production , well sizable increase energy
price . Nonetheless , many participant state expect total inflation
diminish rise core consumer inflation limit . One source upward
pressure inflation rise energy price , seem reasonable
expect price would level even decline mildly , built future
price . Unit labor cost still held moderate wage growth
rise productivity . Indeed , saw distinct possibility positive
productivity surprise , represent downside risk inflation outlook .
Moreover , markup price cost nonfarm business remain quite
high , firm would likely press competition absorb portion
step-up growth unit labor cost , least acceleration limited
extent duration . addition , price many non-energy commodity risen
recent week , input constitute relatively small fraction overall
business cost , and , partly reason , past commodity price

demonstrate little predictive content broad inflation rate . short-term
inflation expectation risen somewhat , longer-term inflation expectation
remain well contain . lastly , monetary policy would aim preserve
price stability .
Still , many participant indicate uncertainty intensity inflation
pressure risen response recent development that , particular ,
distribution possible inflation outcome tilt little upside .
Although monthly statistical release could quite volatile , recent data show
consumer inflation little previous expectation concern . Also ,
anecdotal indication price increase become common across
number industry . business executive reportedly believe that ,
aggregate demand expand robustly low foreign exchange value
dollar put upward pressure import price , degree `` pricing power ''
return . Moreover , recent rebound spot crude oil price , especially
substantial advance price crude oil future contract delivery well
future , suggest significant unwind high energy cost might
prospect . Several participant indicate that , current circumstance , view
upside surprise inflation potentially harmful equivalent
downside surprise , partly outcome could well impart additional
upward momentum inflation expectation .
Committee-s discussion monetary policy intermeeting period ,
member favor boost target federal fund rate 25 basis point
2-3/4 percent meeting . Monetary condition evidently still quite
accommodative , economic activity appear momentum
previously perceive , and , core inflation probably would stay low ,
pressure inflation seem risen . Prospects legislative action apply
significant fiscal restraint unclear , even expansion become increasingly
well establish private demand prove strong resilient . Although
require amount cumulative tighten may increase , member note
accelerate pace policy tighten appear necessary time ,
degree economic slack apparently remain , productivity growth would probably
continue damp increase unit labor cost price , inflation would
likely continue contain . circumstance , Committee member judged
measure removal policy accommodation appropriate now .
discuss announcement release meeting , member agree
appropriate acknowledge recent evolution inflation situation
indicate `` though longer-term inflation expectation remain well contain ,
pressure inflation picked recent month pricing power
evident . rise energy price , however , notably fed core
consumer price . '' Regarding risk sustainable growth price stability ,
member discuss proposal make Committee-s assessment explicitly
conditional assumption appropriate monetary policy underscore
maintain balance risk would require policy action . note
Committee-s assessment balance risk past nine month -- a period
monetary policy steadily tighten -- necessarily interpret
base implicitly assumption policy accommodation would remove .

A number member believe formulaic language nature rigid
reflect evolve economic circumstance satisfactory manner , especially
development subtle complex , member believe
risk assessment discontinue . member ultimately approve make
risk assessment policy announcement follow meeting explicitly
conditional appropriate policy .
Members also focus issue whether reiterate judgment express
Committee-s recent statement `` . . . policy accommodation remove
pace likely measure . '' express view language
could constrain future policy inappropriately ; concern new ,
felt pressing , odds Committee might need
step pace policy firm thought increase . Members note ,
however , exist `` measure pace '' language clearly conditional
economy evolve way promise gradual return high level resource
utilization inflation remain low , thus believe word
rule either pick pace firm pause process remove
policy accommodation circumstance warrant . also note
language preclude notable increase medium- longer-term interest
rate intermeeting period market extend expect gradual
increase policy rate . discomfort express language related
explicitly likely trajectory future policy action . also aver
Committee should , extent possible , provide information would help
public anticipate probable course monetary policy ; provide information
would tend increase effectiveness monetary policy . generally , member
recognize Committee-s statement would need evolve time .
