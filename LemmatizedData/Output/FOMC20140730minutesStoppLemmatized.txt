IOER rate would primary tool use
move federal fund rate target range influence money market rate . addition ,
thought temporary use limited-scale RRP
facility would help set firmer floor money market interest rate normalization . participant anticipate that , least initially , IOER rate
would set top target range federal

bottom federal fund target range . Alternatively ,
participant suggest RRP rate could
set bottom federal fund target range ,
judging might possible begin normalization process minimal reliance RRP
facility increase role necessary . However ,
many participant thought strategy
