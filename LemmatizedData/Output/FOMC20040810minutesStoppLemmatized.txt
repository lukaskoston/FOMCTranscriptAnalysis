consumer spending , previously provide considerable support
aggregate demand , slow sharply second quarter . time ,
growth payroll fall back June July post significant gain
spring . recent moderation growth might portend substantially
slow expansion go forward previously expect , Committee
see sizable shortfall likely outcome . Activity housing
sector remain strong , investment outlay continued advance good pace .

With economic growth buoyed accommodative monetary policy supportive
credit condition generally well robust underlie growth
productivity , Committee believe condition place pace
expansion strengthen enough continue trim margin slack resource
utilization . Indeed , limited available evidence point rebound household
spending , especially motor vehicle , July early August , indicator
suggest continued improvement labor market condition . Regarding outlook
inflation , recent data see consistent assessment
portion high rate price increase record earlier year
reflect transitory factor .
Committee member generally agree high energy price played
important role recent moderation economic growth . direct effect
high energy price real disposable income could account relatively
small part reduction growth consumer spending , member
suggest effect may exacerbate substantial increase
expect future energy cost well great uncertainty cost .
Moreover , economy seem respond past episode sharp
increase energy cost much could explain model . Still ,
Committee member doubt high energy price sufficient
explain recent slowdown spending . Effects increase energy price
consumer business confidence , might lead large spending
response , evident , consequence growth
industrialize country dependent import oil appear fairly
modest thus far . Informed part price future market , Committee member
anticipate energy cost would level perhaps fall back recent
high , note considerable uncertainty outlook .
Policymakers focus comment key sector economy
slowdown consumer spending toward end second quarter . Business
contact part country suggest that , addition high energy
price , unseasonable weather may limited spending time . Committee
discuss number factor may contribute slowdown ,

provide considerable impetus spending , possibility that , stock price
down , save rate near historic low , outlook uncertain , household
may felt need boost saving . Although complete accounting
moderation growth possible , Committee agree resumption
faster growth consumer spending likely . Continued strength home
construction suggest household process retrenching ,
gain income , low interest rate , robust consumer confidence see
undergird gain household spending go forward . Members note
report rise motor vehicle sale July early August firm chain
store sale recent week provide limited evidence consumption
spending pick up .
Investment spending continued advance , though perhaps somewhat
slow pace member anticipate . Several policymakers note
business remain cautious capital spending hire attempt

to boost production much possible exist capacity payroll . Indeed ,
member suggest heighten uncertainty , reflect effect high
energy price increase concern geopolitical risk , might contribute
great business caution late . Nonetheless , business confidence generally
remain high , fundamental investment -- include solid growth
productivity , robust profit cash flow , accommodative financial markets-pointed continued healthy gain business outlay . member also note

discussion recent labor market trend , Committee member note
slow job growth report June July . Committee member point
several factor might contribute recent weakness . Firms- focus
control cost implement productivity improvement
doubtless continue play role . Higher labor cost , particularly related
health benefit , also reportedly weigh firms- hire decision .
However , policymakers note monthly payroll data might provide
incomplete picture expansion economic activity near-term variation
rate growth productivity . addition , many member point data
survey household , show rise labor force participation
decline unemployment rate July , well initial claim
unemployment compensation , remain near recent low . Moreover , survey
data labor market attitude consumer business signal
significant deterioration employment prospect . thing consider ,
Committee expect pace employment gain improve come month .
review outlook price , member note incoming data
intermeeting period show slow core inflation high level post
earlier year , consistent Committee-s view portion earlier
increase reflect transitory factor . Information business contact
suggest number firm able pas least
high energy cost customer , sign widespread price
increase apparent . member express concern development
transportation sector , trucking cost reportedly rise
bottleneck railroad industry trigger delivery delay . Looking forward ,
however , member thought rapid productivity growth flat decline
energy price would limit increase overall unit cost business . Despite
high rate headline inflation earlier year , longer-term inflation
expectation remain well contain slack resource market see
persisting , lead Committee expect underlie inflation relatively low .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period , member
favor increase target federal fund rate 1-1/4 1-1/2
percent . Although pace economic growth moderate second quarter ,

the Committee believe softness would prove short-lived
economy poise resume strong rate expansion go forward . Given
current quite low level short-term rate , especially judged recent
level inflation , member note significant cumulative policy tighten likely
would need foster condition consistent Committee-s objective
price stability sustainable economic growth . context , relatively small
tighten move meeting would help limit risk rise inflation
expectation reduce likelihood policy might need adjust
sharply future , thereby lower attendant risk financial market
economy . member thought policy accommodation probably could
remove gradually -- a view reinforce slow pace growth
moderate rate price increase become evident intermeeting
period . However , member also recognize timing pace additional
policy tighten would depend importantly incoming economic data
