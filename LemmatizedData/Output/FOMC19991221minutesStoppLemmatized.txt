high intermediate- longer-term interest rate evolve market come
expect rise short-term interest rate would need achieve
sustainable , noninflationary growth . However , continued solid economic expansion
abroad expect boost growth U.S . export period ahead . Core
price inflation project rise somewhat forecast horizon , partly
result high non-oil import price firm gain nominal labor
compensation persistently tight labor market would increasingly outpace
even continued rapid productivity growth .
Committee-s discussion current prospective economic development ,
member comment recent statistical anecdotal information
provide evidence persist strength expansion relatively
subdue wage price inflation . economy clearly would carry substantial
expansionary momentum new year , quite possibly excess growth
economy-s long-run potential , key issue Committee whether
growth aggregate demand would slow sustainable pace without
tighten stance monetary policy . Members note regard
evidence slowdown expansion quite marginal point seem
limited largely soften housing activity . Looking beyond near

term , member continued anticipate moderation growth domestic
demand , though extent moderation remain subject wide range
uncertainty related part difficulty anticipate trend stock market
price effect business consumer sentiment spending . Members
also note prospective slow domestic demand likely offset ,
least extent , growth export foreign economy
group continue strengthen many forecaster anticipate .
Uncertainties level growth potential output dynamic
inflation process make difficult relate confidence projection demand
activity prospect inflation . Members observe saw indication
impressive gain productivity might moderate and , indeed ,
recent data suggest acceleration . Moreover , persistent disparity
household establishment series employment growth might
reconcile high immigration previously estimate , boost
potential growth . Nonetheless , increase aggregate demand exceed
even now-higher sustainable rate growth aggregate supply , indicate
decline pool available unemployed worker low level
rise import . difference growth demand potential
supply could well persist unless demand moderate . Absent possible moderation ,
upturn unit labor cost see likely possibility , eventual adverse
implication price inflation . Inflation pressure might also augment
time number special factor rise energy price , effect
import price dollar-s depreciation strengthen foreign economy ,
faster increase medical cost . several factor imply limited price
level adjustment , could become embed degree ongoing inflation
effect wage increase inflation expectation . nearer
term , however , subdue inflation expectation likely damp incipient
uptrend rate price inflation .
review economic condition across nation , several member note
high level business activity severely tax available labor resource
appear constrain growth number industry part
country . Rising employment income along advance stock market
price new high recent week foster elevate level consumer
confidence would support consumer spending go forward . Anecdotal
report point notably brisk retail sale current holiday season
many part country . Sales new automobile rebound recently
moderate somewhat exceptionally rapid pace earlier . recent
development provide little basis anticipate slow growth consumer
spending , member comment spending could vulnerable adverse
development stock market attendant effect consumer wealth
confidence ; spending household durables could damped anticipate
softness housing activity .
capital good market also displayed little evidence weakening .
continued characterize disproportionately large investment high-tech
business equipment , although demand conventional equipment , apart
farm equipment , also relatively robust . Assessments outlook overall

business capital investment point rapid growth lead outlay
equipment . Business spending construction expect change little
whole , strength sector , warehouse facility , offset softness
sector industrial structure office building . member note ,
however , public work project would help support overall construction
activity .
Recent data along anecdotal report indicate loss vigor nation-s
housing market , though overall activity still high level . recent pace
homebuilding somewhat uneven , relative strength area support
seasonally favorable weather condition large backlog . Rising mortgage rate
cite key factor underlie limited moderation residential
construction , factor include scarcity skilled construction worker ,
divert nonresidential construction project , indication
overbuilding area . Looking ahead , member anticipate
growth income ready availability financing homebuyers would
sustain overall housing activity relatively high level .
Forecasts indicate real net export would continue decline

development perspective numerous business firm , demand might
add pressure U.S . resource potentially inflationary implication ,
depend extent growth domestic demand would slow go
forward . Several member indicate concern burgeon current

demand .
comment regard outlook inflation , number member
express concern anticipate moderation overall demand might
large enough soon enough forestall add pressure already-taut labor
market . Although wage growth remain moderate date unit labor cost
damped , point tighten labor market would begin generate wage gain
increasingly excess productivity gain . Indeed , member concerned
unit labor cost could begin accelerate even exist labor utilization level .
addition , force restrain inflation -- decline oil ,
import , commodity price , subdue increase cost health care -- have
already reverse . Even so , result acceleration price inflation might held
possibly avert time economy-s buoyant upward trend
productivity , could support profit margin help maintain highly
competitive condition many market make difficult impossible
business firm raise price . addition , evidence

erosion widespread expectation inflation would remain subdue
long run .
Committee-s discussion policy period immediately ahead ,
member endorse proposal maintain unchanged policy stance consistent
target federal fund rate center 5-1/2 percent . member
agree Committee-s primary near-term objective foster steady
condition financial market period century date change
avoid action might erode markets- confidence Federal Reserve
fully prepared provide whatever liquidity would need period .
member generally agree that , necessary , concern rise inflation
could address meeting early February . saw little risk
significant acceleration inflation near term , give recent price trend
absence indication inflationary expectation might deteriorating ,
thus little cost defer consideration policy tighten action . Moreover ,
Committee would well position early February ass delayed
effect earlier tighten action .
issue intermeeting tilt Committee-s directive ,
member express preference retain symmetry adopt
November meeting . preemptive tighten move might warrant
not-too-distant future help contain inflationary pressure economy ,
member believe symmetrical directive would best convey message
tighten action contemplate week immediately ahead .
directive would therefore consistent desire avoid
misinterpretation policy intention might unsettle financial market
sensitive century-date-change period . view , longer-run concern
rise inflation could address press statement would issue
meeting . member indicate marginal preference asymmetric
directive focus possibility eventual rise interest rate .
view , asymmetric directive would consistent consensus among
Committee member regard likely course monetary policy
next meeting use bias statement come encompass
longer horizon understood financial market participant
public . Moreover , directive widely anticipate financial market
hence would incur little risk view market disturbance week
immediately ahead . However , could readily accept symmetrical directive
light contemplate press announcement .
