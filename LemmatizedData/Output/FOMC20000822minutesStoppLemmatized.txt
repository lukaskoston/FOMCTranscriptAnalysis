Open market operation direct throughout intermeeting period toward
maintain federal fund rate Committee-s target level 6-1/2 percent ,
rate average close intend level . interest rate generally
move low period , extend decline begin spring .
Factors contribute recent reduction include economic data release
view , balance , confirm earlier indication demand growth
slow sustainable pace price pressure would remain
damped , thereby lessen potentially obviate tighten monetary

policy . broad index stock market price rise somewhat period
since June meeting .
foreign exchange market , trade-weighted value dollar increase net
index major currency , even though interest rate differential move
asset denominate dollar relative industrial country .
least part , dollar-s appreciation reflect heighten market perception

brisk . However , partial data period since midyear suggest overall
growth household business borrowing might also slow somewhat .
expansion M2 decline substantially since late spring , apparently part
result widen opportunity cost hold asset M2 stem
high market interest rate possibly also slacken growth household
income . Sluggish currency flow another contribute factor . time ,
M3 accelerate July partial data point robust growth August .

inflow M3-s institutional money fund component .
staff forecast prepared meeting suggest economic expansion ,
slow appreciably elevate pace recent quarter , would
sustain rate little staff-s upwardly revise estimate
economy-s potential output . forecast anticipate expansion domestic
final demand would held back extent wan eventual
disappearance positive wealth effect associate outsized earlier gain
equity price high interest rate . result , growth spending
consumer durables expect stay well recent quarter
housing demand stabilize level recent high . contrast , expansion
business fix investment , notably equipment software , project
remain robust , solid economic growth abroad expect boost
expansion U.S . export period ahead . Core consumer price inflation
project rise somewhat forecast horizon , part result high
import price largely consequence increase nominal labor
compensation gain would fully offset growth productivity .
Committee-s discussion current prospective economic condition ,
member agree information available since midyear provide increase
evidence growth aggregate demand aggregate supply
come closer balance . statistical evidence review Committee ,
support widespread anecdotal report , point noticeable
slow expansion demand economic activity . slowdown lead
moderation consumer spending decline housing expenditure

be occur even full effect earlier tighten financial condition
felt . time , apparent continued acceleration underlie
productivity boost economy-s potential output growth and , context
leveling broad measure equity price year ,
without full feedback demand previous acceleration . price
rise somewhat year ago , pickup seem reflect
direct indirect effect high energy price , increase productivity
growth kept unit labor cost well contain despite rapid gain
compensation . development much improve prospect
sustainable economic expansion prevail stance monetary policy . Even so ,
member anticipate labor market would remain exceptionally tight ,
labor compensation already accelerate high energy price potentially
raise inflation expectation , agree risk remain weight toward
rise inflation .
Committee-s discussion outlook economy , member focus
considerable attention growth rate economy-s supply potential -- its
ability satisfy growth demand sustainable basis . widespread
application technological advance associate surge outlay capital
equipment foster acceleration labor productivity seem
ongoing . Data productivity capital accumulation become available
recent month tend confirm trend , statistical evidence
reinforce comment many business executive persistent upward
revision long-term profit forecast , yet suggest leveling
productivity growth .
Quickening productivity fundamental factor behind economy-s
remarkable performance recent year . Members note , however , historical
episode involve major change productivity trend rare past
therefore provide limited basis evaluate course future productivity
development . Accordingly , considerable caution need exercise assess
outlook productivity rely projection economy price ,
necessarily embody judgment outlook , make monetary
policy . Another source uncertainty related interaction rise productivity
aggregate demand . course recent year , accelerate productivity
gain tend boost aggregate demand even potential aggregate
supply owe effect strong profit investment spending and ,
rise stock market , consumption well . However , leveling stock
price year suggest recent increase productivity growth built
market expectation price time ago likely provide
impetus demand go forward past productivity acceleration .
Members caution nonetheless possibility long-term interest rate
equity price yet adequately reflect ongoing productivity gain could
rule out , attendant effect boost demand . Finally , rise productivity clearly
major force contain inflation period unusually low
unemployment rate , interaction productivity
growth wage price could adduce , interaction involve complex
process difficult ass give paucity prior experience .

consequence , judgment labor market pressure , productivity , inflation
view care basis evolve development .
review outlook expenditure key sector economy ,
member observe growth consumer spending moderate substantially
period exceptional gain late 1999 early 2000 . clearest evidence
soften consumer demand tend concentrate sale motor vehicle
housing-related durable good . Available data reduce growth consumer
spending support anecdotal report slippage retail sale
expectation several part country . Factors underlie development
include diminish wealth effect several month limited change equity
price , cumulative buildup stock motor vehicle consumer
durables own public , constrain effect high energy price
income available spent good service . factor might
well continue damp growth consumer spending go forward , member
note consumer confidence remain high level , consumer income
rising , anecdotal evidence point marked deterioration
consumer spending would pose potential threat sustainability
economic expansion .
housing sector provide clearest indication response aggregate
demand firm interest rate , affect industry produce construction
material household furnishing . Anecdotal report much country
tend confirm statistical evidence downward trend housing start
home sale . Factors help explain softness housing , include rise
occur mortgage interest rate report overbuilding
metropolitan area , expect continue exert downward pressure
housing activity . However , reference also make indication wealth effect
continue boost housing demand price part country .
sharp contrast development consumer housing sector , business
outlay capital equipment software continued rise exceptional rate ,
even several year rapid growth . persistence dramatic expansion
evidently reflect expectation capital investment would continue earn
high rate return . Although extraordinary rate increase investment
outlay currently displayed little sign abating , historical pattern indicate
even dramatic surge shift technology invariably lose momentum
new technology widely adopt , rate return investment
tend diminish . reliable way anticipate timing
downturn indeed little reason expect turnaround nearer term
current investment boom . Members note , however , investment outlook
nonresidential construction sector present much mixed picture .
business investment continued exhibit considerable vigor many area ,
clearly weaken others nation whole seem poise
relatively subdue advance come quarter . One factor point latter
direction evidence cautious attitude part many business
executive especially lending institution .

The strengthen economy many U.S . trading partner foster rise
demand U.S . export , trend seem likely persist accord report
many domestic business contact . Nonetheless , nation-s current account
deficit apparently continued increase , development member
express concern view risk pose foreign exchange value
dollar domestic inflation time . Still , experience last year
clearly demonstrate dollar likely remain strong long foreign
investor continued see attractive investment opportunity United States .
Past experience also suggest international capital flow quickly reverse
themselves , timing major turnaround dollar , any , could
predict degree confidence .
Committee-s discussion outlook inflation , member note overall
measure price inflation picked fairly high level standard
recent year , largely result high energy cost . Moreover , supply factor
major energy market -- petroleum , gas , electricity generate capacity -- do
point significant relief considerable period time . Still , core consumer
price index remain relatively damped risen little last year ,
especially measure PCE chain-price index , suggest
underlie price pressure remain largely contain . Nonetheless , number
member concerned unusually taut labor market could begin
point show increase labor compensation excess productivity
gain , pressure unit cost price . Evidence yet emerge , perhaps
productivity continued accelerate , flatten rate
increase productivity , even high level , could well pose point risk
continued favorable inflation performance . sure , number
positive factor outlook inflation , include highly competitive condition
many market , stable relatively favorable expectation regard longerrun inflation outlook , sign remarkable acceleration productivity
continue . balance , however , member saw mild upward trend key
measure inflation distinct possibility , albeit one subject
considerable uncertainty .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead ,
member endorse proposal retain current stance policy , consistent
federal fund rate continue average 6-1/2 percent . assessment
factor lead decision , member focus evidence
moderate demand accelerate productivity closing gap
growth aggregate demand potential supply , even earlier Committee
tighten action exert full restrain effect . recent rally
domestic financial market could view partially erode degree
monetary restraint implement earlier , real interest rate private borrower
still relatively elevate level , banking institution continue report
tighten standard term business loan , equity price
risen modestly , dollar firm recent month . addition ,
last reading core inflation suggest upward drift , unit
labor cost increase , longer-term inflation expectation
stable time . Accordingly , Committee incur little risk leave
stance policy unchanged meeting wait see various factor

affect supply demand economy unfolded influence
prospect economic activity price .
time , many member emphasize Committee need
prepared act promptly inflationary pressure appear intensifying ,
Committee-s discussion balance-of-risks sentence include
press statement would issue meeting , member agree
sentence continue indicate risk economy remain
weight toward high inflation foreseeable future . member
expect underlie inflation intensify materially , especially nearer
term , statement intend express view longer term ,
horizon agree risk lay direction price acceleration .
risk high inflation time see importantly stem
unusually taut condition labor market , could place upward pressure
unit cost price , especially productivity growth level future .
member also cite potential persistently high energy price affect
longer-run inflation expectation , possibility that , take consideration
recent decline long-term interest rate , financial condition might yet tight
enough balance aggregate demand potential supply face optimism
growth labor capital income association accelerate
productivity .
