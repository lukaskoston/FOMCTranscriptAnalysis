meeting December 19 , 2000 , Committee adopt directive
continued call maintain condition reserve market consistent
unchanged federal fund rate 6-1/2 percent . time , however ,
member conclude balance risk shift sufficiently
weight toward condition could generate economic weakness
foreseeable future . Indeed , recent information seem signal sudden
weakness , largely anecdotal aggregate data spending
employment suggest continued economic expansion , albeit relatively slow
rate . result , member believe would prudent await
confirmation noticeably weaker expansion implement monetary
easing , particularly give current high level resource utilization record
last several year strong rebound brief lull growth . If , however ,
incoming data reinforce recent anecdotal indication , Committee
would prepared respond promptly .
Open market operation intermeeting period initially direct
toward maintain federal fund rate Committee-s target level 6-1/2
percent . However , information become available week December
meeting tend confirm earlier indication weakness spending ,

result , growth spending consumer durables expect appreciably

software , project resume relatively robust growth comparatively
brief period adjustment capital stock desirable level ; growth abroad
see support expansion U.S . export ; fiscal policy assume

Committee-s discussion current prospective economic development ,
member comment slowdown expansion second half
2000 unexpected light previously unsustainable rate increase
output , speed extent slowdown much pronounce
anticipate . Consumer spending business capital investment decelerate
markedly , partly association sharp decline consumer business
confidence . weakening , especially evident durable good produce
industry , lead large cutback manufacturing output numerous business
firm attempt pare view excessive inventory . eventual
degree duration soften economic condition difficult predict .
particular , unclear whether pause economic expansion would
largely limited relatively short inventory correction would involve
extensive cyclical adjustment .
general , member saw favorable prospect appreciable recovery overall
business activity year progress . Members refer indication
residential nonresidential construction activity remain relatively robust
fragmentary data anecdotal report suggest consumer spending
steady possibly turn early year . Several comment sound
condition banking system another supportive factor . also observe
that , counter experience generally associate onset earlier
recession , monetary growth well maintain recent month ,
note long-term interest rate currently appreciably peak
past year . prospect fiscal policy might begin move expansionary
direction later year cite another factor outlook strong
economic activity . decline energy price , materialize anticipate
future market , would positive effect business consumer
spending lower business cost raise disposable consumer income

adjust energy cost . Perhaps critical element outlook
persistence elevate growth structural labor productivity , seem likely
play vital role support growth income aggregate demand also
help limit inflation pressure .
time , member also saw considerable downside risk economic
expansion . Energy price remain elevate continue depress business
household purchasing power ; overhang excess capital stock
sector could turn sizable , depress investment spending time ;
consumer confidence could worsen appreciably face weaker expansion
income high job layoff ; investor concern earnings could
increase far , spark low equity price tighter standard term
credit .
Except price energy medical service , currently available information
indicate relatively subdue rate inflation , recent survey point little
change inflation expectation . Looking ahead , member anticipate somewhat
reduce pressure labor product market would foster soften
consumer price inflation come quarter , development would abet
price oil natural gas ease year line current market
expectation .

growth business activity fall short expansion economy-s
potential , rate unemployment expect rise somewhat average
4-1/2 percent fourth quarter year . Forecasts rate
inflation , measure chain-type price index personal consumption

marked deceleration final sale experienced late last year concentrate
consumer spending motor vehicle durable good business
expenditure equipment software . household sector , rapidly decline
consumer confidence , apparently associate important measure increase
worker layoff grow concern future job prospect , contribute
generally disappoint retail sale holiday season .
evidence sale stabilize possibly risen slightly January , though part
improvement could reflect steep price discount purpose reduce
inventory . negative factor cite member include adverse wealth
effect decrease stock market valuation , relatively high consumer debt
service burden , possible retrenchment consumer extend period
large increase purchase related buildup consumer durables . Nonetheless ,
absence possible development lead deterioration consumer

sentiment , member saw reasonable prospect strengthen consumer
spending year even assume decline expenditure relative
income . important factor outlook expectation reduction
energy price , would boost disposable income available non-energy
expenditure likely provide fillip consumer sentiment process .
Moreover , relatively high rate growth structural productivity show
little sign waning , longer-run prospect household income remain
positive . balance , various factor weigh outlook consumer
spending later year seem favorable , though substantial downside risk clearly
would persist interim period uncertain duration .
depress effect lag final sale business investment spending , notably
equipment software , reinforce deterioration financial balance
sheet business firm , tighter supply condition segment credit
market , buildup excess capacity erode profitability . regard ,
member refer earlier unsustainable rate investment many high-tech
firm oblige retrench despite still high rate growth
demand product service . regard nonresidential
construction sector , member provide anecdotal report continued high level
activity several part country little evidence substantial
overbuilding characterize construction industry earlier period
develop economic weakness . balance , business investment outlook
seem vulnerable somewhat great project weakness short run ,
member persuade that , background large continue gain
structural productivity cost saving investment equipment
software , business firm likely accelerate spending new capital
period adjustment .
Concerning outlook housing activity , recent statistical anecdotal report
indicate housing sale construction well maintain indeed
bright spot several region . Reduced mortgage interest rate appear
largely offset marked decline consumer confidence . Accordingly ,
contrary experience earlier period soften economic activity ,
stabilization housing activity pace near current fairly high level see
reasonable expectation .
outlook inventory investment uncertain . drop final sale
late 2000 evidently much faster generally expect , inventory
rise considerably fourth quarter whole despite sharp downward
adjustment manufacturing output . keep just-in-time inventory policy ,
further recent year advance technology allow
faster complete reading sale adjustment order , effort
reduce inventory continue recent week net inventory liquidation
anticipate current quarter . Looking ahead , number member
comment expect period inventory correction would
relatively sharp short historical standard . Improvements inventory
management related indication inventory overhang small compare
earlier historical experience factor assessment . time ,
member recognize inventory correction begin duration

would depend importantly ongoing strength final sale . regard ,
development bearing business consumer confidence willingness spend
would play crucial , though point uncertain , role .
Members express divergence view regard outlook foreign
economic activity implication domestic economy . emphasize
nation-s important trading partner grow economy
likely provide support expand U.S . export . member
concerned indication grow weakness number foreign economy
might increasingly inhibit U.S . export add competitive pressure U.S .
producer domestic market . large current account deficit see factor
point potential depreciation dollar time , adverse repercussion
domestic inflation albeit favorable effect export .
