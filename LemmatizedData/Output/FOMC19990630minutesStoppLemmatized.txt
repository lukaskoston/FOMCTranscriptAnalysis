Industrial production advanced somewhat May despite sharp weatherrelated drop utility service continued sluggishness mining activity .
Manufacturing output register another substantial advance , reflect surge

manufacture many durable good . output nondurable good post
another small increase May , gain fairly broadly base . Reflecting
stepped-up pace manufacturing , rate utilization capacity edge high
May continued long-run average level .
Growth consumer spending appear slow somewhat

result , single-family multifamily housing start fell somewhat balance
April May .
Information shipment nondefense capital good April May suggest
business investment durable equipment picked substantially second
quarter already brisk pace first quarter . Shipments high-tech
equipment , notably computer , particularly robust April-May period .
addition , business demand motor vehicle continued strong , particularly
medium heavy truck backlog unfilled order still quite
large . contrast , nonresidential construction activity weaken April ( late data )

after rise first quarter , available information contract future
construction point sluggish building activity period ahead .
Business inventory accumulation slow bit April relatively subdue

twelve month . Wholesale stock rise April average pace
early month year , ratio stock sale sector stayed

nominal deficit U.S . trade good service widen somewhat April
first-quarter average . value export increase slightly firstquarter average , primarily reflect great export computer
semiconductor , motor vehicle , industrial supply . value import rise
somewhat more , principally owe large import oil . available information
suggest economic activity picked somewhat balance major
foreign industrial country . Japanese economy report expand
markedly first quarter , record first quarterly rise past year
half . Europe , economic growth rebound Germany slow somewhat
France United Kingdom . Signs improve economic performance also
evident Latin America Southeast Asia .
consumer price index unchanged May follow sizable increase April
associate part jump energy price . Excluding effect
movement food energy price , though , consumer inflation little high
April-May period first quarter ; twelve month end May ,
core consumer price rise slightly less previous twelve-month period .
Producer price finish good also affected volatility energy price
April May , core producer price record small rise month .
However , twelve month end May , core producer inflation
noticeably compare year-earlier period , owe important part sharp
increase price tobacco product . regard labor cost , average hourly
earnings grow little faster May April , rise less twelve
month end May previous twelve-month period .
meeting May 18 , 1999 , Committee adopt directive call
maintain condition reserve market would consistent
unchanged federal fund rate 4-3/4 percent , directive also contain
bias toward possible tighten policy . members- concern inflation
increase appreciably since meeting late March , member
nonetheless felt current stance policy could remain consistent
subdue inflation time , especially productivity gain continued robust and ,
project , growth aggregate demand moderate somewhat month
ahead .

Open market operation direct throughout intermeeting period toward
maintain federal fund rate around 4-3/4 percent , average rate
period close Committee-s target . interest rate rise
somewhat period since May meeting response combine effect
Committee-s announcement asymmetric directive , economic data
generally strong expect , report comment Federal Reserve
official . market effect high interest rate roughly offset brighter
second-quarter earnings prospect , broad index share price equity market
change little balance intermeeting period .
foreign exchange market , trade-weighted value dollar edge
intermeeting period relation currency broad group important U.S .
trading partner . dollar appreciate euro , partly reflect
contrast continue robust growth United States generally subpar activity euro-area economy . dollar also rise pound
association slow growth United Kingdom reduction Bank
England-s repo rate . contrast , dollar weaken yen yield
Japanese government debt increase sharply relative rate U.S . Treasury
security . Among important trading partner , dollar fell
currency many emerge Asian economy , whose financial market generally
improve , appreciate term Brazilian real association period
particular stress Brazil-s financial market .
record sizable increase April apparently associate taxrelated buildup liquid account , growth M2 M3 slow sharply May ,
tax payment clear , appear remain moderate June .
expansion aggregate also seem damped recent month
rise opportunity cost associate earlier increase interest rate .
M2 estimate increase year June rate somewhat
Committee-s annual range M3 rate near upper end range .
Although growth total domestic nonfinancial debt moderate little recently ,
continued expand pace somewhat middle range .
staff forecast prepared meeting suggest expansion would
gradually moderate rate commensurate growth economy-s
estimate potential . lag effect earlier rise foreign exchange value
dollar expect place continue , though diminishing , restraint
demand U.S . export period ahead . increase private final demand
would restrain anticipate wan positive wealth effect associate
earlier large increase equity price ; slow growth spending
consumer durables , house , business equipment wake prolong
buildup stock item ; rise already occur
market interest rate , especially intermediate longer maturity ,
expectation high interest rate would need achieve well balance
aggregate demand aggregate supply . Price inflation project rise
somewhat projection horizon , large part result upturn
import price slight firm gain nominal labor compensation would
fully offset rise productivity .

In Committee-s discussion outlook economic activity inflation ,
member comment incoming information continued suggest vigorous
expansion also subdue inflation despite tight labor market . Growth
aggregate demand estimate slow somewhat second quarter
outsized advance two previous quarter , largely result less
ebullient though still robust growth consumer spending . member question ,
however , whether limited indication moderation expansion
recent month harbinger sustainable pace economic activity
would consistent economy-s estimate output potential low inflation .
Indeed , absence policy firm member saw tighten
labor market updrift measure inflation significant risk .
acknowledge timing extent potential rise inflation subject
considerable uncertainty . particular , experience recent year amply
demonstrate , strengthen advance productivity reduce increase unit
cost low even slightly negative level despite grow scarcity labor
rise growth labor compensation profit margin . Rising
productivity growth sufficient , however , keep labor market
tightening , give extraordinary strength final U.S . demand , continued
would show high inflation . Moreover , remain unclear long
faster gain productivity could continue offset increase labor cost avert
intensification price inflation .
keep practice meeting Federal Reserve-s semiannual
monetary policy report Congress Chairman-s associate testimony ,
member Committee Federal Reserve Bank president currently
serve member provide individual projection growth nominal
real GDP , rate unemployment , rate inflation year 1999
2000 . regard growth nominal GDP , forecast range
5 5-1/2 percent 1999 whole 4 5 percent 2000 . forecast
rate expansion real GDP 1999 central tendency 3-1/2 3-3/4
percent 2000 center range 2-1/2 3 percent ,
increase experienced last three year . civilian rate unemployment
associate forecast central tendency 4 4-1/4 percent
fourth quarter 1999 4-1/4 4-1/2 percent fourth quarter 2000 .
Projections rate inflation , measure consumer price index , point
appreciable increase 1999 , largely reflect swing price energy ,
little change 2000 ; specifically , projection converge CPI
inflation rate 2-1/4 2-1/2 percent 1999 2 2-1/2 percent 2000 .
member anticipate effect century date change economic activity
would , balance , limited negligible forecast period , possibly add
somewhat growth later year temporarily reduce growth early next year .
Key factor underlie members- forecast appreciable moderation trend
real GDP growth include wan financial stimulus boost
domestic demand recent year buildup stock consumer durables ,
housing , business equipment extend period rapidly expand
purchase . member acknowledge sign slow growth household
business spending still quite limit . household sector ,
substantial increase income financial wealth high level consumer

confidence foster continued robust growth consumer spending recent
month , apart exceptional strength purchase motor vehicle , growth
real spending durable consumer good appear moderate recently
rapid pace earlier year . long favorable factor
continued stimulate substantial growth consumer expenditure would persist
uncertain , notably regard outlook stock market price
effect consumer resource willingness spend . stimulus household
spending rapidly rise stock market wealth obviously would diminish
price stock market tend level many expect . event , growth
consumer spending might expect moderate pace line
expansion disposable income .
Business investment spending , feature exceptional growth expenditure
producers- durable equipment , appear picked recent month
already rapid pace earlier year . Nonetheless , business firm expect
trim growth outlay equipment forecast moderate expansion
aggregate demand materialize . cutback would abet extent
somewhat high level market interest rate business borrower
face . growth spending high-technology equipment related product
probably would remain rapid light accelerate pace innovation
decline price equipment , significant deceleration slowdown
spending type capital equipment seem likely project
economic condition , especially give currently reduce rate capacity utilization
many manufacturing industry . nonresidential construction sector , business
expenditure expect remain near current level , reflect ongoing
strength many part country also sign overbuilding
area .
number recent indicator suggest seasonally adjust basis
residential building activity slow bit second quarter elevate
level earlier year . However , homebuilding apparently held back
extent recently scarcity labor building supply , sizable backlog
evidently built up . Looking ahead , member expect residential construction
expenditure hold near current level second half year backlog
work low , anticipate soften subsequently . Factors
bearing outlook include large addition stock housing recent
year extent backup occur mortgage rate .
point high financing cost would begin show housing demand .
available information indicate U.S . export good service
decline balance thus far year , import post strong gain
line continue strength U.S . domestic spending . However , improve
economy number nation-s important trading partner slow
expansion forecast U.S . economy expect favorable effect
export moderate increase import next several quarter . Indeed ,
recent data suggest U.S . export advanced slightly post sizable
decline first quarter import continued grow strongly .
net , member anticipate nation-s trade balance would continue

worsen , although slowly less negative effect U.S . economy
forecast period .
Members comment inflation reflect wide range statistical
measure anecdotal report remain remarkably subdue despite persist
strength expansion tight labor market across nation . seem
likely rise productivity , appear accelerate markedly late ,
account much surprising combination rapid growth economic
activity low inflation . particular , accelerate labor productivity clearly
curbed rise unit labor cost damped pressure price . recent data
underlie productivity trend yet available , fact profit
forecast continued marked suggest might still accelerate
hold cost . increase productivity along slack foreign
economy contribute strong competition market
continue generally suppress effort raise price . factor constrain
inflation cite member include ample availability capacity
industry decline occur non-oil import price . Despite
favorable development , member become increasingly worried
risk overheat economy rise inflation time .
concern outlook inflation tend focus risk that ,
absence appreciable moderation overall demand , tight labor market
would point foster significantly faster increase labor compensation
could longer offset strong productivity growth . Indeed , recent rate
increase output , labor utilization likely continue rise , add pressure
cost . high labor cost increase would turn generate rapid price
inflation . Members note regard trend average hourly earnings
appear tilt recent month . relatively recent development
yet conclusive evidence accelerate labor cost , especially without
information productivity , anecdotal report faster increase labor
compensation also appear multiply . addition , improve economic
condition abroad , among factor , induced firm oil
commodity price , support foreign exchange value currency
relative dollar . consequence , decline commodity import
price help suppress inflation inflation expectation last
two year likely repeat . Members acknowledge prospect
rise inflation , include potential timing acceleration , any , remain
uncertain , give question surround ongoing strength aggregate
demand outlook productivity , view risk add price
pressure risen far .
keep requirement Full Employment Balanced Growth Act
1978 ( the Humphrey-Hawkins Act ) , Committee review meeting
range growth monetary debt range establish February
1999 set tentative range aggregate 2000 . current range
approve February period fourth quarter 1998 fourth
quarter 1999 , unchanged last several year ,
include growth 1 5 percent M2 2 6 percent M3 . unchanged

range 3 7 percent also set February growth total domestic
nonfinancial debt 1999 .
member favor retain current range year extend
provisional basis 2000 . member recognize growth
M2 M3 , decelerate markedly 1998 , might still exceed range
current year near upper end range 2000 , assume
economic financial condition approximate current expectation .
However , case many year , member remain concerned
forecast money growth still subject wide range error term
anticipate relationship money growth aggregate economic
performance . Accordingly , agree range reflect
center forecast money growth project economic financial
condition , regard anchor benchmark money growth
would associate approximate price stability sustain economic
expansion , assume behavior velocity line historical experience .
reaffirmation range 1999 extension 2000 would therefore
underscore Committee-s commitment achieve maintain price stability
time thereby foster maximum sustainable economic growth . note
discussion apparent pickup productivity , persist ,
suggest somewhat high range adopt recent year might
accurately reflect money growth condition price stability
historically typical velocity trend . However , member agree marked
degree uncertainty outlook productivity well velocity argue
increase range point .
Committee member unanimously favor retain current range
3 7 percent growth total domestic nonfinancial debt 1999 extend
range provisional basis 2000 . take account staff projection
indicate growth debt aggregate likely around middle
range , perhaps somewhat 1999 somewhat 2000 . Unlike
range monetary aggregate , selection range debt reflect
price stability sustainable economic growth rationale base forecast
actual growth measure .
conclusion discussion , Committee vote reaffirm range
growth M2 , M3 , total domestic nonfinancial debt establish
February 1999 extend range tentative basis 2000 . keep
usual procedure Humphrey-Hawkins Act , Committee would
review preliminary range 2000 early next year . Accordingly , Committee
vote incorporate follow statement regard 1999 2000 range
domestic policy directive :
Federal Open Market Committee seek monetary financial condition
foster price stability promote sustainable growth output . furtherance
objective , Committee reaffirm meeting range
establish February growth M2 M3 1 5 percent 2 6 percent
respectively , measure fourth quarter 1998 fourth quarter 1999 .
range growth total domestic nonfinancial debt maintain 3 7

percent year . 2000 , Committee agree tentative basis set

Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead , one
member support proposal slight tighten condition reserve market
consistent increase Â¼ percentage point federal fund rate
average around 5 percent . view member , policy move
represent desirable cautious preemptive step direction reduce
saw significant risk rise inflation . current indication
accelerate inflation quite limit , economy expand rapidly
enough put add pressure labor market time , many member
express grow concern that , give current stance monetary policy ,
persist strength domestic demand augment increase demand
abroad would show point even tighter labor market high
inflation , would impinge time economy-s ability realize full
growth potential . circumstance , small preemptive move time would
provide degree insurance worsen inflation later . Members comment
action question would reverse portion ease action implement
fall 1998 undertaken part protect
possibility unsettled global market would place even great constraint
foreign domestic economic activity evident . financial market
foreign economy stabilize recover , add protection longer
require policy need move less accommodative stance promote
sustainable growth spending . One member agree tighten
policy necessary contain inflation , give persistence low inflation ,
accelerate productivity , view already sufficiently restrictive
monetary policy stance .
member divide whether retain current asymmetrical directive
tilt toward restraint adopt symmetrical directive conjunction
contemplate tighten action . majority endorse proposal shift
symmetrical directive . agree follow today-s limited policy move
risk would still remain tilt toward rise inflation , expect
announcement change policy shortly meeting would include
reference Committee-s ongoing concern regard . light
marked degree uncertainty relate extent timing prospective
inflationary pressure , believe firm policy might
necessary near term case would depend importantly future
development . member concerned retention asymmetry
might interpret indication Committee relatively certain

would need take tighten action fairly soon , view tend
reinforce behavior expectation period announcement
shift asymmetry May meeting .
Members prefer retain asymmetrical directive agree that , although
little likelihood policy change intermeeting period ,
directive best way convey concern risk rise
inflation potential need policy tighten time . number
favor asymmetry concerned symmetrical directive would capture
Committee-s think regard likely policy course
extend period time could foster mislead conclusion
Committee longer believe adjustment policy might warrant
point later year . saw odds reasonably high
tighten would need end year gain adequate assurance
inflation would contain . Despite differ preference , member
support policy tighten move also indicate could accept
symmetrical directive announcement release meeting
along Chairman-s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony latter part
July could serve correct possible misinterpretation .
