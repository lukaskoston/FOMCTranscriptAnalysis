generally anticipate rebound rate economic expansion balance

potential . Growth rate would represent noticeable slow pace
prevail recent year , realization depend importantly
damp effect domestic demand less accommodative financial condition
developed recent month -- high long-term interest rate flatten
equity price . Given persistent strength domestic demand improve
economy abroad , many member saw risk outlook tilt
upside , especially short-term interest rate remain current level .
background , risk outlook price also seem tilt
toward somewhat high inflation . Price inflation held check

mixed whether acceleration productivity persisting , earlier
favorable development import price already dissipating , add
inflation risk pose possibility tighten labor market
domestic demand fail moderate .

favorable prospect continued robust growth employment income

likely would sustain appreciable expansion consumer expenditure .
However , substantial uncertainty surround outlook stock market price
whose sharp rise associate increase wealth course recent
year help foster high level consumer confidence willingness
spend . absence large gain stock price , recent trend persist ,
would remove stimulus probably induce moderation growth

order many type equipment softness nonresidential construction
point considerable deceleration total business investment . time ,
however , advance technology decline price likely underpin
continued strong expenditure computer communication equipment ,
thereby sustain still robust reduce increase overall business investment .
Residential construction activity expect moderate bit come

backlog built earlier year associate shortage inventory
new home work down . Indeed , anecdotal report indicate currently
strong housing market several area country . time , outlook
employment income provide support housing market , likely
modestly diminish level .
outlook inventory investment remain characteristically uncertain , though
member comment reason anticipate pickup
investment follow shortfall second quarter . long-run trend
undoubtedly remain direction decline inventory-sales ratio ,
shortfall inventory investment spring probably whole
lower holding least temporarily intend level evidence part
anecdotal report lean inventory reduce sale area . Moreover ,
buildup relate century date change concern seem likely ; regard ,
anecdotal report suggest business plan accumulate inventory
form import question availability good
around year-end . Members acknowledge available survey anecdotal
evidence point widespread perception significant need build
inventory , indeed indication overstock industry .
Even so , appreciable inventory accumulation see likely prospect
balance year . forecast subject substantial risk
direction , imply , realize , significant boost GDP growth second
half year .
government sector expect exert somewhat less restraint overall
demand economy , burgeon budget surplus seem weaken
restraint federal government outlay tax cut possibility . addition ,
export growth project strengthen conjunction improve
economic outlook number important U.S . trading partner , import growth
seem likely moderate next several quarter , reflect project

trade outlook despite improve economic performance many country .
Adverse development country remain worrisome concern light
unsettled political condition make difficult government authority
many implement measure need solve underlie
economic problem .
course Committee-s discussion outlook inflation , member
comment persuasive evidence recent statistical measure
price inflation currently pick inflation expectation rising ,
though decline inflation expectation experienced course
recent year longer seem occur . Members nonetheless express
concern risk acceleration foreseeable economic
circumstance . cite variety statistical anecdotal sign could
view harbinger rise price inflation . include upturn commodity
price , notably oil whose effect tend time spread relatively widely
economy , direct indirect effect dollar-s depreciation .
Members also report indication reduce discounting business firm
plan for , actual implementation of , high price business saw
less likely earlier reverse competitive reason . However , report
still relatively scatter .
members- basic concern outlook inflation related possibility
continued strength demand might accommodate without place
great pressure labor compensation price . great risk would come
tighten labor market , many member also concerned
possibility accelerate cost even current level labor resource
utilization . major uncertainty extent labor productivity would
continue accelerate hold rise unit labor cost . Recent data
product side national income product account suggest slow
productivity growth pressure unit labor cost , tendency
confirm close reading income side data . circumstance , outlook
price inflation remain subject considerable uncertainty .
Committee-s discussion policy period ahead , member one
exception favor proposal slight tighten condition reserve market
would consistent increase federal fund rate average
5-1/4 percent . view member , limited policy move time
would appropriately supplement small firm action take midyear
least would position monetary policy need foster
continued subdue inflation good economic performance . would tend
validate appreciable firm financial market occur recent
month , extent anticipation Committee tightening . firm
important hold expansion economic activity sustainable pace , especially
improve foreign economy boost demand U.S . export . key
measure price point suggest upturn inflation , failure act
would incur substantial risk increase pressure already tight labor market
high inflation . discussion , member observe today-s

action would reduce stimulus provide autumn last year
counter global financial turmoil related risk U.S . economy .
vestige turmoil disappear , financial condition improve
markedly , foreign economy strengthen balance , downside risk
economic performance United States generally reduce . One member
indicate light persistence low inflation policy tighten move
warrant time would fact incur risk unnecessarily curb
expansion economic activity .
member support tighten action also favor retention
symmetric directive . member agree Committee keep
option open regard next policy move , whose direction timing would
depend evolve economic financial condition . regard , agree
inflation risk substantially reduce action take June
contemplate today-s meeting , many member continued see possible increase
inflation pressure main threat sustain economic expansion . However ,
anticipate tighten would need near term ,
allow Committee time gather substantial additional information
balance aggregate supply demand . member agree symmetric
directive would preclude tighten move warrant development
month ahead .
