income sharp rise stock market price course recent year .
member observe slightly less ebullient consumer behavior recently
might influence extent volatility downward movement
stock market course past several week . Higher financing cost
probably also begin play role . Looking ahead , experience recent
year amply demonstrate difficulty forecasting performance stock
market . failure large increase materialize , occur , would
time imply neutral even negative net impact wealth
positive effect earlier advance played out , latter would
take time .
background factor likely govern prospective behavior
housing activity . evidence downturn homebuilding still quite
marginal , anecdotal report suggest high mortgage rate
start exert retard influence housing demand . Even so , member
continued identify area remarkable strength across nation , overall
housing construction remain elevate level . assumption
growth job income line current forecast absent markedly high
mortgage financing cost , housing activity might reasonably expect settle
level bit recent high .
Business investment spending retain strong upward momentum , though
exhibit uneven growth pattern recent quarter importantly reflect Y2K

demand . time , foreign demand U.S . good service would
expand , thereby add demand pressure U.S . producer resource ,
thing equal . latter regard , several member mention anecdotal evidence
grow export demand variety domestic product .
discussion outlook inflation , member focus statistical
anecdotal indication tighten labor resource , acceleration
measure labor compensation , early sign possible upturn underlie
price inflation . Data employment , reinforce anecdotal commentary

around country , continued provide evidence extremely tight labor market ,
least part country appear tighten since
early year . Business contact spoke spending great deal time
expense attract retain worker concomitantly persist effort
improve productivity operation accommodate burgeon growth
demand face labor force constraint . report rise
wage benefit increase cost nonlabor input could longer fully
offset improvement productivity , business firm appear
attempt consider increase sell price maintain improve
profit margin . However , ability set high price , least raise
significantly , continued severely constrain persistence strong
competition across much economy . Indeed , example successful effort
mark price , tend concentrate product use oil-related input ,
still exception . Even so , member believe risk acceleration
core price appreciably high give current trend aggregate
demand , pressure resource , development foreign economy .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead ,
member endorse proposal tighten reserve condition sufficiently raise
federal fund rate Â½ percentage point level 6-1/2 percent . forceful
policy move 25 basis point increase implement since mid1999 desirable light extraordinary persist strength overall
demand , exceed even increasingly rapid growth potential supply ,
attendant indication grow pressure already tight market labor
resource . strength demand might be , least part , result
ongoing acceleration productivity , latter feed back demand
high equity price profitable investment opportunity . Financial
market seem recognize need real interest rate rise
circumstance , market assessment always correct ,
evidence suggest substantial tighten meeting need
limit inflation pressure . member saw little risk relatively aggressive
policy move , give strong momentum expansion widespread market
expectation move . great risk economic expansion point
policy sluggish adjusting , thereby allow inflationary
disturbance dislocation build . 50 basis point adjustment likely
help forestall rise inflationary expectation that , least opinion
member , already show sign worsening . widespread view Federal
Reserve would take whatever step need hold inflation time
probably contribute persistence subdue long-run inflation
expectation extend period rapidly rise demand press
limited supply resource . Today-s policy move would undergird relatively
benign expectation help assure success Committee-s policy .
member agree balance risk sentence would include

recent meeting , even today-s tighten action member believe
risk would remain tilt toward rise inflation . view risk base
primarily persist momentum aggregate demand growth
