Committee-s discussion current prospective economic condition ,
member comment information become available since
previous meeting reinforce earlier indication appreciable slow
expansion economic activity . cumulate evidence moderate expansion
seem especially clear information employment growth manufacturing
output . Aggregate demand currently appear grow pace little
rate increase economy-s output potential , configuration could well
persist come quarter . Actual expect shortfall business profitability
lead tighter credit condition many borrower low equity price ,
would continue restrain spending ; moreover , pressure profit margin ,
adverse effect financial market , business investment , consumer
spending , distinct possibility . Members observe , however , economic
growth rebound sharply temporary slowdown previously current
expansion , several note possibility less restrictive fiscal policy stance
would bolster demand year ahead .
Although soften aggregate demand move direction contain
potential inflation pressure , member continued concerned
possibility inflation would edge high . Even demand growth slow , labor
market likely remain unusually tight time ,

optimism equity market analyst group regard outlook earnings
long term . suggest contact among business executive
remain fundamentally upbeat long-term prospect productivity
earnings . circumstance , appreciable growth investment spending
seem prospect come quarter , though undoubtedly slow pace
experienced average recent quarter .
Even limited slow expansion investment expenditure could expect
retard effect growth consumer income spending .
spending held well third quarter , limited information available
recent development suggest softening , though data
conclusive . Factors cite support somewhat weaker trajectory consumer
spending include impact elevate energy cost , high debt burden many
household , ebb wealth effect strong earlier gain stock
market price . Even so , anticipate increase employment income still
relatively high level consumer confidence likely support appreciable
growth consumer spending , albeit probably rate somewhat
brisk pace past year .
Key indicator housing activity fluctuate considerably year ,
evidence recent month point balance mild soften activity ,
perception support anecdotal report several area around
country . general , housing demand expect edge low response

express concern financial economic weakness number foreign
economy . Failure remedy structural problem country
incur risk economic financial distress , possible spillover effect
economy financial market . risk seem small , might
difficult contain . exchange value dollar another source
uncertainty outlook . view member , dollar could well come
downward pressure nation-s current account deficit continued

cumulate . low dollar would tend favorable effect trade deficit
also would add inflationary pressure domestic economy .
Members continued concerned outlook inflation . Measured
increase `` headline '' consumer price could explain mostly result sharp
advance energy price , many observer expect reverse
point . However , core consumer price measure also displayed gradual uptrend ,
perhaps part consequence passthrough effect persistently high
energy price . Measures labor compensation appear accelerating , partly
result sharply rise health benefit cost . sure , unit labor cost
nonfinancial corporate sector change little past year , undoubtedly
reflect impressive gain productivity . Even so , high interest rate
increase energy input cost add overall production expense .
date , competitive pressure continue inhibit ability many firm
pas cost , although significant exception number successful
effort impose energy surcharge .
Looking future , however , member generally agree risk
direction heighten inflation pressure despite belief growth
overall demand seem decline sustainable pace
probably would continue expand time rate economy-s
output potential . member believe growth labor compensation likely
remain upward pressure anticipate persistence tight
condition labor market would enable wage catch earlier gain
labor productivity . Whether offset increase growth labor productivity
would materialize open question , part productivity growth might
tend level context less ebullient expansion business investment .
Another key factor outlook inflation course oil energy
price . Thus far , increase energy cost reflect marginally core
consumer price , widespread market expectation decline
oil price come quarter , great deal uncertainty , include potential
difficulty Middle East , surround timing extent

direction gradual uptrend core inflation .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead ,
member support proposal maintain unchanged policy stance consistent
federal fund rate continue average 6-1/2 percent . Despite clear
indication moderate expansion economic activity , persist risk
heighten inflation pressure remain policy concern , particularly context
evident , gradual , uptrend key measure core inflation . Indeed ,
member comment measure core inflation already near slightly
level view acceptable longer run . Although overall
financial condition tighten course recent month currently

appear hold growth spending , add restraint likely
necessary contain inflation pressure . circumstance ,
member saw maintenance steady policy best course juncture
promote Committee-s longer-run objective price stability sustainable
economic expansion .
Still , growth slow quickly many member anticipate ,
financial market development seem likely keep pressure
resource mount come quarter . circumstance ,
member focus meeting potential desirability move
statement risk weight toward rise inflation one indicate balance
view risk Committee-s goal price stability sustainable economic
growth . member agree strong case could make shift
balance risk statement previous meeting . indicate
decision close call them , several comment development might
move direction would make shift advisable relatively near
future . Even so , unanimous conclude change would
premature time . Concerns possibility rise inflation persist .
member could see increase risk marked slow growth
relative rapid rate expansion economy-s potential , degree
growth demand might remain sufficiently damped contain offset
inflation pressure quite uncertain . Moreover , shift Committee-s
publish view might induce undesirable soften overall financial market
condition , would tend add inflation pressure . member
conclude retain risk statement weight toward inflation pressure
would best represent current thinking , believe desirable
provide recognition emergence increase downside risk
economic expansion statement release meeting .
