However , additional evidence sluggish business investment recent
development subprime mortgage market suggest downside risk
relative expectation moderate growth increase week since
January FOMC meeting . time , prevail level inflation remain
uncomfortably high , late information cast doubt whether core
inflation expect downward path . participant continued expect
core inflation would slow gradually , recent reading inflation

tight . Business contact continued report shortage skilled worker technical
professional field , significant wage pressure occupation , well
scarcity less skilled unskilled worker area country . far ,
aggregate measure labor compensation show moderate increase ,
but , look ahead , possibility labor cost might rise rapidly see

pressure price core good service . Moreover , rate resource
utilization near high end historical experience suggest possibility
inflation pressure could build . Participants agree risk around
expect desire path gradual decline core inflation remain mainly
upside ; note upside risk inflation appear increase
slightly recent month .
