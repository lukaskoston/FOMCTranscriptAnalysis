Committee-s discussion current prospective economic development ,
member comment economy clearly continue contract , lead
inventory liquidation ongoing reduction capital spending . decline
inventory likely abate long , boost production , course
recovery would depend behavior final demand . recent statistical
anecdotal information mixed case earlier point
balance toward moderation decline overall final demand ; first
time long incoming data call downward revision
current forecast . member agree , however , evidence emerge
stabilization economy remain quite tentative timing strength
eventual recovery continued surround high degree uncertainty ,
risk economy still clearly tilt toward economic weakness . Among
risk , member cite apparently reduce prospect additional fiscal
stimulus legislation , vulnerability current stock market valuation
forecast robust rebound earnings fail materialize , possibility
terrorist incident , especially potentially adverse effect consumer
confidence spending additional deterioration labor market condition .
Nonetheless , critical consumer sector hold relatively well thus far ,
member continued anticipate upturn economy year ahead

light progress already make business firm reduce excess inventory
unwind capital overhang , beneficial effect decline energy
price . lag effect substantial ease monetary policy year
fiscal stimulus measure already enact law expect buttress
demand economic recovery next year . outlook inflation
view favorable , give slack labor product market , subdue
inflationary expectation , prospect aggregate demand would remain
well economy-s potential output next several quarter .
consumer sector , major downside concern possibility
substantial deterioration labor market condition , widely
anticipate , could significant inhibit effect consumer confidence ,
income , spending . potentially adverse economic factor cite member
include rise consumer debt burden , risk downturn stock market ,
recent rise mortgage interest rate . increase , among thing ,
would impinge extraction capital gain turnover refinance
exist home , provide important support consumer spending .
However , consumer expenditure appear relatively well sustain
thus far , evidently part result widespread price discounting low interest
rate , include zero rate many motor vehicle loan , help
overcome currently high degree caution price consciousness among
consumer . Moreover , recent survey evidence suggest consumer confidence
might stabilize earlier decline . significant decrease occur
price fuel oil gasoline positive factor would continue
bolster household spending while . Looking ahead , unclear
various factor affect consumer would interact , though apart likely
downward adjustment sale motor vehicle sustainable level
follow recent surge , member generally anticipate solid gain
consumer spending would underpin economic recovery .
Like consumer spending , new home construction sale displayed
considerable resilience recent month , apparently large part result
relatively attractive mortgage interest rate perhaps extent
consequence favorable weather condition many part country . Though
overall housing activity remain high level , member report soften
activity area nation , notably apartment unit major city .
Sales high-end house also continued relatively depress . regard
outlook , recent rise mortgage interest rate could expect
retard effect housing activity . Even so , absence seriously adverse
shock confidence , housing activity seem likely hold near current level
quarter immediately ahead .
Business capital spending appear continue decline rapid pace
business firm persist effort bring production capacity well
alignment forecast growth sale . near-term outlook sale
profit remain relatively depress , prospect significant pickup
spending equipment software seem favorable period
immediately ahead . Businesses report cautious , many
business executive await concrete indication improve market

proceed plan investment expenditure . Even so , member refer
tentative indication , uptick order durable good
expectation improve sale high-tech product , might signal
turnaround overall capital spending come quarter . progress
adjust capacity strengthen profit expectation would point lead
upturn spending new equipment software , business contact
indicate timing individual firm would vary considerably , delay
extend case 2003 . New construction nonresidential structure
decline sharply past several quarter , vacancy rate still
rise many key market sizable decline anticipate year
ahead . member report high insurance cost since September 11
terrorist attack exert inhibit effect nonresidential
construction activity region .
liquidation business inventory appear accelerate current
quarter , foster important extent large decline stock motor
vehicle . Inventories seem approach level firm would start
reduce rate liquidation early next year perhaps turn inventory
accumulation year ahead progress , give boost production
income . Anecdotal report provide support outlook , include
widespread indication retail inventory already quite lean level , even
outside motor vehicle sector . time , recent survey result point
less discomfort current inventory level though inventory
correction anticipate manufacturing .
fiscal stimulus remain active debate Congress ,
rapid approach date adjourn current session ,
questionable whether legislation would enact year . Although
expansionary fiscal policy already place result earlier legislation
stimulus might legislate next year , especially economy continued
deteriorate , member saw additional boost near-term economic activity
new fiscal initiative increasingly unlikely . member also comment
mount state local government deficit , largely result diminish
income sale tax receipt , adverse implication governmental
budget spending various part country .
Reflecting unusually synchronous global economic development , foreign nation
also experience sluggish economic activity many instance actual
recession . weakness reflect decline U.S . export . Members saw little
prospect foreign economy would strengthen sufficiently
provide significant independent impetus U.S . export , least near term .
Instead , upturn foreign economic activity would depend recovery
United States .
Expectations output would remain economy-s potential time
lead many member believe underlie inflation might well edge low
currently modest level . Reinforcing outlook recent evidence
somewhat faster anticipate productivity growth , prospect world
economic condition would hold energy price , sharp drop near-term

inflation expectation household report recent survey . Moreover , labor
compensation appear decelerate trend despite rapid increase
cost healthcare worker benefit . circumstance give
persistence highly competitive condition domestic international market ,
ability business raise price likely remain quite limited
even nonexistent . number member refer possibility
disinflation , also note risk deflationary spiral seem
limit , give economy-s self-correcting resilience ongoing effect
stimulative fiscal monetary policy .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead , one
member indicate support proposal ease reserve condition slightly
far , consistent 25 basis point reduction federal fund rate level
1-3/4 percent . sign weakness aggregate demand
might abating , sign still quite limited tentative . now ,
contractionary force continued depress overall economic activity , subpar
economic performance seem likely persist , least time . Moreover ,
number member saw substantial risk economic activity could even fall short
projection stabilization near term moderate recovery later next
year . circumstance , consequence inactivity meeting could
turn considerable , several member view ease action
measure insurance potential great prolong economic
weakness currently anticipate . modest ease action take today
turn unneeded , Committee would ample opportunity reverse
action without incur real risk allow inflationary pressure gather
momentum , give project degree slack resource use current
absence significant inflationary pressure . risk policy reversal ,
prove need near term , would foster significant market unsettlement
seem limited light widespread expectation ease
meeting follow policy turnaround next year .
time , member emphasize stance policy already quite
accommodative , much effect recent easing yet felt ,
tentative sign suggest economy economic outlook begin
stabilize . circumstance several saw decision ease close call ,
favor balance give weight possible consequence
restrain force economy persist great extent currently
expect . view one member , policy already sufficiently stimulative
outlook improve enough warrant pause ass development .
event , member comment Committee-s ease cycle likely
approach completion , several suggest desirability signal
view public .
Given view risk economy , member support
