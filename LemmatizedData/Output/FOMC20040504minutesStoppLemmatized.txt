2004 . Real federal expenditure jumped first quarter expect
rise balance year . Next year , fiscal impetus likely
diminish , largely owe expiration tax provision permit partial
expense certain capital outlay . Assessing prospect fiscal policy ,

Nonetheless , extent development signal upturn
underlie inflation unclear . degree , recent uptick various price

measure partly reflect factor , jump price energy non-oil
import , unlikely repeat . Also , recent evidence could
interpret indicate surprisingly sharp decline measure inflation
2003 exaggerated drop underlie rate inflation . Indeed , member
saw underlie inflation relatively stable put low odds possibility
price accelerate . view , range factor continue
restrain inflation , include slack resource utilization , strong productivity gain
correspond downward pressure unit labor cost , currently high price
markup , longer-term inflation expectation apparently remain contain .

inflation prediction base estimate output employment gap
subject considerable error .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ,
member favor maintenance exist target 1 percent federal fund
rate . recognize Committee would need initiate process
remove monetary policy accommodation point , recent experience
suggest time policy firm appropriately would commence might
closer previously seem probable . However , appreciable rise
real long-term interest rate intermeeting period imply financial
market condition already tighten balance . Moreover , evidence
significant acceleration hire still limit , member refer
possibility growth could falter , particularly market yield rise sharply
far . inflation low resource use slack , Committee saw continuation
exist policy stance provide degree support economic
expansion still appropriate .
regard Committee-s announcement release meeting ,
understood recent evidence hire picked up , well
continued solid growth output , would highlight . Policymakers also concur
that , expansion apparently well establish , statement
indicate upside downside risk sustainable growth next
quarter seem roughly equal . Members saw downside upside risk
prospect inflation . probable persistence slack economy
least several quarter , together likelihood recent substantial gain
productivity would extend , continue exert slight downward
pressure inflation . time , though , recent stronger-than-expected
increase number price measure , anecdotal information suggest great
ability business implement sustain price hike , multiply sign
solid economic growth suggest upside risk inflation increase .
member agree that , thing consider , risk goal price stability
move balance period since last meeting .
Committee also discuss length advantage disadvantage
modify drop statement announcement follow March
meeting `` With inflation quite low resource use slack , Committee believe
patient remove policy accommodation . '' member
agree that , policy tighten likely begin sooner previously expect ,
reference patience longer warrant . Committee focus instead

on formulation would emphasize policy tightening , begin , probably
could proceed pace would `` measure . '' number policymakers
concerned assertion could unduly constrain future adjustment
stance policy evidence emerge come month suggest
appreciable firm would appropriate . Others , however , saw substantial benefit
inclusion propose language . member note current economic
circumstance make likely process return policy neutral
set would gradual , way , past episode inflation
well level consistent price stability . addition , policymakers
observe timing magnitude future policy adjustment would
ultimately determine Committee-s interpretation incoming data
economy price rather current expectation development .
balance , member agree could accept indication
