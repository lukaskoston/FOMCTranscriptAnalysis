labor market condition still improve gradually . Averaging recent month ,
even entire year , employment growth fast enough absorb
unutilized labor resource time . Anecdotal information suggest significant

demand less skilled worker still appear soft . Recent survey hire plan

business read signal future gain employment . Despite

compensation increase picked materially generally remain
moderate .
discussion outlook price , number participant cite
development could pose upside inflation risk . Although oil price fall
late , still considerably high spring ,
recent decline dollar would raise import price diminish competitive
pressure many industry . pass-through source limit ,
still potential source upward pressure price could get
embed high inflation certain circumstance . addition , productivity
growth slow appreciably recent quarter unit labor cost
increase , raise question cost pressure go forward . participant
also note uncertainty extent resource slack economy
considerable quite possible economy could soon operating
close potential , particularly labor force participation rate turn much
employment continued register gain . increase last month
five-year measure inflation compensation derive Treasury nominal
inflation-indexed security might warn sign expectation
well anchor summer .
Despite concern , participant generally expect inflation would remain
low foreseeable future . depreciation dollar recent month
notable , participant found persuasive evidence recent
study point decline time across country pass-through
exchange rate movement domestic price . Forward market-based measure
inflation compensation beyond next five year well survey measure
short- long-term inflation expectation quite stable late , despite
previous rise energy price low dollar . Moreover , several participant

risk . Although participant generally acknowledge degree economic
slack quite uncertain , moderate pace wage compensation growth
recent month face high energy price several year rapid
productivity growth consistent economy still operating somewhat
potential . similar vein , recent quarterly dip productivity growth

outlook productivity growth could significant . Even structural
productivity growth slow , price markup remain quite elevate

Presidents ) favor raise target federal fund rate 25 basis point
2Â¼ percent meeting . member judged quarter-point
tighten target federal fund rate meeting appropriate light
