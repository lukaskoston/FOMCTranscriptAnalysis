near end ease cycle . time , several emphasize
want rule ease later warrant tenor incoming
economic information .
except one member accepted proposal retain Committee-s press

conclusion discussion , Committee vote authorize direct
Federal Reserve Bank New York , instruct otherwise , execute
transaction System Account accordance follow domestic policy
directive :
Federal Open Market Committee seek monetary financial condition
foster price stability promote sustainable growth output .
long-run objective , Committee immediate future seek condition

economic weakness foreseeable future .
Votes action : Messrs . Greenspan , McDonough , Ferguson , Gramlich , Hoenig ,
Kelley , Meyer , Ms . Minehan , Mr . Moskow .
Votes action : Mr . Poole .
Mr . Poole dissent believe FOMC action year already
establish highly stimulative monetary policy stance . M2 MZM measure
money risen annual rate excess 10 percent 20 percent
respectively past six month , real federal fund rate likely

below equilibrium level . qualitative information financial
condition point direction . Economic forecast economy-s
growth would resume later year fact long-term interest rate
decline since December also indicate market anticipate revival faster
economic growth long . Given lag monetary process , believe
add monetary policy stimulus raise undue risk foster high
inflation future . Moreover , background , especially
concerned statement Committee continued view balance risk
weight toward weakness would read market sign
Committee likely ease near term . thought future
development equally likely warrant action either direction ,
think Committee take step probably would cause expectation
ease become embed market interest rate .
