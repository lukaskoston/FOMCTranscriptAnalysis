1/2 percentage point , level 6-1/2 percent . member note
relatively forceful move necessary give persist growth aggregate
demand excess expansion potential supply , create rise
pressure already tight market labor resource . view ,
action would help bring aggregate demand well alignment time
potential supply thereby work forestall emergence inflationary
expectation buildup inflationary pressure . also note even

this additional firm risk still weight mainly direction rise
inflationary pressure .
Open market operation intermeeting period direct toward
implement desire increase pressure reserve position , federal

staff forecast prepared meeting continued suggest economic
expansion would moderate gradually currently elevate pace rate
around perhaps little growth economy-s estimate potential .
expansion domestic final demand increasingly would held back
anticipate wan positive wealth effect associate earlier large gain
equity price high interest rate ; result , growth spending
consumer durables house expect slow far . contrast , business
fix investment , notably purchase equipment software , project
remain robust , continued solid economic growth abroad would boost growth

of U.S . export period ahead . Core price inflation project rise
noticeably forecast horizon , partly result high import price
firm gain nominal labor compensation persistently tight labor
market would fully offset productivity growth .
Committee-s discussion current prospective economic development ,
member cite evidence slow expansion economic activity recent month .

motor vehicle , member agree eventual extent duration
slow overall economic growth subject substantial uncertainty .
number factor support projection considerably moderate expansion

2000 , include likelihood much effect spending rise
interest rate leveling equity price year yet felt .

sector economy business fix investment continued display
substantial vigor , member could confident growth would
rebound clearly unsustainable pace , occur previously expansion .
regard inflation , member observe steep increase energy price
boost overall rate inflation somewhat , addition high energy price
likely contribute indirectly rise core measure inflation . number
member also concerned rise core inflation could generate
increasingly unsustainably tight labor market , note labor cost
would need monitor closely even growth demand slow sufficiently
keep level resource utilization unchanged . date , however , rise
productivity growth contain labor cost pressure , despite moderation
expansion activity , early sign slow growth
productivity .

purchase could pick again . course consumer spending remain
uncertain , member conclude that , context relatively high level
consumer confidence sizable project gain job income , slow still
solid expansion consumer expenditure likely occur come
quarter .
housing market also provide clear evidence weaken demand .
slowdown evidently reflect effect high mortgage interest rate

earlier run-up stock price cumulatively large addition stock
housing economy . sluggish tone housing data confirm
anecdotal report slow residential sale building activity part
country . Despite development , sizable building backlog many area ,
outlook continue growth consumer income , still favorable consumer
sentiment likely support substantial homebuilding activity , albeit
reduce level . least part country , firm supply building
material home furnishing begin feel retard effect
slowdown housing market .
surge early year evidently reflect part investment spending

recent month expect remain quite robust next several
quarter . New order many type business equipment remain strong ,

many domestic business , would add overall demand pressure U.S .
producer resource time latter already operating high
level .
regard outlook inflation , member give considerable attention
somewhat faster increase broad price measure past year ,
differ extent regard prospect increase inflation .
generally agree development relate energy would continue exert
upward pressure price near term , include passthrough indirect
effect high oil price core measure inflation . Looking beyond near
term , number member , note core measure consumer price
rise rapidly year , concerned price might well continue
accelerate gradually , even assume economic expansion would sustain
pace close economy-s potential . view , labor market already
operating level utilization likely eventually produce rise labor
cost would pass market price even productivity growth
remain high rise somewhat far . member optimistic
core inflation might contain near current level . recent increase core
inflation could largely reflect indirect effect rise energy price . date ,
unit labor cost quite subdue , leave open question
sustainable level labor resource use . Rising productivity likely continue
restrain unit labor cost degree , product market remain highly
competitive . However , even member saw considerable inflation risk
slowdown aggregate demand fail sustain , member generally
agree foreseeable future possible increase underlie inflation
remain principal risk continued good performance U.S . economy .
contrast earlier practice , Committee meeting establish
range growth money debt 2000 2001 . legal requirement set
announce range recently expire , member view

surround outlook economy , notably extent duration
recent moderation spending effect appreciable tighten
past year , include Â½ percentage point increase intend federal fund
rate May meeting , reinforce argument leave stance policy
unchanged meeting weight incoming data carefully . Several member
comment considerable amount new information bearing
prospective strength economy outlook inflation would become
available relatively long interval next meeting August .
Members generally saw little risk defer policy tighten move ,
particularly since possibility underlie inflation would worsen appreciably
seem remote prevail circumstance . Among factor , inflation
expectation remarkably stable despite rise energy price , real
interest rate already relatively elevate .

remain weight toward rise inflation . Indications growth aggregate
demand moderate pace closer potential supply still partial
tentative , labor market remain unusually tight . Many Committee
