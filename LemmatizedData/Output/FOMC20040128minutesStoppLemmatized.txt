Committeeâs discussion current prospective economic development ,
member comment information become available since
December meeting tend validate earlier assessment expansion
firmly establish robust economic growth , way since mid
2003 , likely continue year progress . Many emphasize business
expenditure appear solid upward trajectory amid widespread
report much improve business sentiment . Indeed , business expenditure
broaden source significant strength expansion , earlier
sustain mainly household government spending . Factors underlie
favorable outlook economic activity continued include stimulative fiscal
monetary policy , accommodative condition financial market , positive
effect strong uptrend productivity business investment incentive and ,
lag , household income . member nonetheless express
disappointment acceleration economic activity thus far fail
generate significant strengthen employment , though point number
positive sign labor market . Given expectation persist above-trend
economic growth , saw increase demand worker likely prospect go
forward . Regarding outlook inflation , member observe wide margin
slack labor product market continued hold wage price ,
especially give concurrent strength productivity . Core consumer inflation
appear drift low recently , number member mention
possibility modest decline inflation current subdue level .
year ahead , however , member generally anticipate little net change
consumer price inflation .

member also view business inventory investment likely provide
support economic expansion year ahead . Business inventory
exceptionally low level relation sale , brisk growth demand
broadly line current forecast materialize year , business firm could
expect make commensurate addition inventory . Indeed , inventory
appear turn fourth quarter decline balance earlier
2003 business evidently become confident increase sale
would sustain .
business expenditure turn up , employer continued display

tend hold hire continue ability business firm meet
increase demand improve productivity exist workforce rather

Looking ahead , member saw considerably faster growth employment
likely prospect context strengthen aggregate demand
expectation slow growth productivity extraordinary
pace recent quarter . Several emphasize , however , timing extent
improvement employment subject considerable uncertainty .
household sector continue supply major impetus expansion .
Household spending benefiting stimulative fiscal monetary policy ,
wealth effect rise real estate equity price , increase consumer
confidence economic outlook . Members note retailer many part
country report solid sale holiday period . respect
outlook overall consumer spending , suggest elevate growth
productivity could expect raise income time thereby help
buttress consumption even stimulus earlier tax cut fade . Residential
construction activity remain high level , evidently support part recent

decline mortgage interest rate . Contacts housing industry indicate
expect high level construction activity 2004 , though perhaps
robust 2003 .
Fiscal policy provide considerable stimulus economy would continue
first part year , reflect large tax refund anticipate
result overwithholdings 2003 . Beyond nearer term , however , fiscal
stimulus project diminish exist legislation . regard , one
member question whether robust expansion would sustain fiscal
impulse remove . member express concern longer-run
prospect large federal deficit implication future performance
economy .
comment international economy , member note

Committeeâs discussion outlook inflation , member agree
increase core consumer price likely remain mute year ,
ongoing strength expansion gradually reduce current output gap
anticipate gain productivity exert downward pressure cost price .
member comment , however , relationship output gap
inflation quite loose outlook productivity remain
uncertain . Accordingly , member agree change core consumer price
inflation likely limit , divergence opinion
probable direction . view many , modest disinflation
appear likely prospect . member note disinflation ,
associate rapid growth productivity , could view nonthreatening . Moreover , expect strength aggregate demand would curb
extent disinflation time . member express differ view core
consumer price might well edge course year light
considerable stimulus stem current monetary fiscal policy
possibility expect pickup economic activity employment , especially
high side current forecast , would associate slow
growth productivity . evidence point possibility uptick
inflation still quite limit , member note addition sizable

however , pricing power business firm remain quite limit .
Committeeâs discussion policy intermeeting period ahead ,
member favor unchanged policy stance direct toward maintain
reserve condition consistent target federal fund rate 1 percent .
member persuade relatively vigorous economic expansion

firmly establish likely point call move toward
neutral policy stance , conclude adjustment warrant
current circumstance . regard stress unused labor
resource remain substantial , inflation low level ,
inflation expect change appreciably either direction year
ahead . Members acknowledge risk maintain might
eventually prove overly accommodative policy stance ,
judged desirable take risk side assure rapid elimination
economic slack .
regard word Committeeâs press statement release shortly
meeting , member discuss length desirability retain
reference earlier statement prospect accommodative policy could
maintain âfor considerable period.â exist language explicitly
qualify December meeting tie low inflation slack resource
use , thereby underscore notion move away current degree
policy accommodation would depend economic condition rather simply
passage time . member agree change word desirable ,
signal policy tighten move near term , rather increase
Committeeâs flexibility take action deem desirable
underline decision would make basis evolve economic
condition . However , difference opinion arose regard specific
proposal consideration , namely remove reference âconsiderable
periodâ substitute one refer âpatience.â fully endorse
proposal believe new word conveyed important information
Committeeâs strategy environment price stability economic slack
circumstance unlikely outsized effect financial market .
number member comment expectation sustain policy
accommodation appear contribute valuation financial market

market adjust appropriately change economic circumstance
future . member , express agreement respect merit
language change , nonetheless prefer drop reference âconsiderable
