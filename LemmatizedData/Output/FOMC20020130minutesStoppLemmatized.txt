uncertainty prospective strength final demand . stimulus fiscal
monetary action take 2001 , impetus growth inducement
new investment provide improve technology , persist uptrend
household spending would support economic recovery . However , household
spending relatively robust cyclical downturn likely
limited room pickup come quarter , intense competitive pressure

concerned acceleration final demand could modest , least
time . background , prospect continued low inflation remain
favorable , give currently reduce utilization resource indeed
prospect add slack economic growth remain potential
come quarter , many member anticipate . Moreover , passthrough
earlier decline energy price would continue ease pressure price cost
generally throughout economy .
prepare semi-annual monetary policy report Congress , Board
member Reserve Bank president provide individual projection
growth GDP , civilian unemployment , consumer price inflation year
2002 . project economy would begin recover year
generally mild downturn experienced 2001 , pace expansion would pick
gradually unemployment rate would climb somewhat far .

quarter year center 6 6-1/4 percent . forecast consumer
price inflation year , measure PCE chain-type price index ,
narrowly cluster around 1-1/2 percent .
regard prospective course project recovery , member generally
anticipate positive swing inventory investment abet growth
consumer spending would provide important upward thrust expansion
nearer term . inventory correction occur past year
magnitude would inevitably result reduce rate liquidation
eventual restock unless , contrary current expectation , consumer spending
weaken markedly . accompany fillip production income would
positive feedback effect time household expenditure business

household expenditure . spending held remarkably well face
major adverse development , include sharp decline stock market wealth
rise unemployment , exacerbate event September 11 .
household remain confident future equity price rebound
post-attack decline , sustain growth household expenditure see
likely prospect . spending also would support part
strengthen less weakness important sector economy .
member nonetheless cite number potential negative relate prospect
consumer spending , include possibility adverse effect consumer
confidence anticipate increase unemployment risk
generally disappoint business profit widespread downward
restatement report profit might generate sizable decline stock market
price consumer wealth . Moreover , unusually large sale motor vehicle
degree durable good closing month 2001 might
borrow extent sale come month . balance , positive
negative factor bearing outlook consumer spending suggest
moderate growth reasonable expectation .
Residential construction expenditure , like household spending consumer good
service , held well despite cyclical downturn employment
sizable net loss stock market wealth . Low mortgage interest rate and , recent
month , favorable weather condition provide vital support sector
economy . Recent housing activity , include record sale area , suggest
persist underlie strength residential construction . Even so , large addition
supply new home earlier year tend indicate additional
impetus , any , housing construction would limited next several
quarter .
outlook business capital expenditure improving , anecdotal report
suggest business executive still notably cautious formulate
spending plan , indication accelerate capital investment still quite
limit . high-tech sector , positive sign note demand
computer peripheral , outlook communication equipment still

very negative . Business spending equipment also expect remain
soft . balance , capital investment sector seem likely retard overall
advance economic activity quarter immediately ahead many firm
continued pare excess capacity business await clearer indication rise
demand profit . Beyond nearer term , however , favorable outlook
productivity growth related profit opportunity point revival robust
capital spending . Indeed , past experience suggest rebound capital
spending take hold easily could exceed current forecast moderate acceleration .
Fiscal policy would continue provide substantial stimulus economy year
light ongoing effect tax reduction measure enact 2001
sharp increase federal government spending train . outlook
incorporate possible enactment tax cut legislation , whose prospect
seem remote . partial offset federal government stimulus

important economy might spread could overlook . Recovery abroad ,
notably key U.S . trading partner , would tie important extent

Inflation likely remain quite subdue . Indeed , core inflation could well edge
low . indirect effect decline occur energy price would
continue hold input price pass fully final
purchaser . generally , low rate resource utilization anticipate
year ahead , rise productivity , highly competitive market pricing could
expect moderate price pressure . background , member continued
view great risk economy relate concern economic
activity rather price .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead ,
member agree recent development argue keep stance policy
unchanged time . Monetary policy ease substantially past
year , and , real federal fund rate unusually low level , policy seem
well position support economic recovery force restrain demand
