Committee-s discussion current prospective development , member
agree economy strengthen somewhat go `` soft
patch '' late spring early summer . Recent data anecdotal information
suggest solid growth ahead , pace could well less brisk
previously anticipate . Consumer spending appear rebound third
quarter . Business investment also robust , executive , especially
large firm , seem cautious outlook several
month ago . Although high energy price played important role damp
growth , question remain reason shortfall expectation
held spring , several policymakers remark uncertainty
likely pace expansion go forward risen . Members comment
benign incoming data price tend confirm previous judgment
increase inflation earlier year importantly reflect temporary factor
core inflation would probably remain relatively low .
discussion development key sector economy , policymakers
agree business investment would likely continue provide considerable
impetus overall economic expansion go forward . anticipate
expansion aggregate demand boost investment . Also , low real interest rate ,
strong business balance sheet , high level profit cash flow expect
support capital spending . However , extent federal tax provision
permit partial expense investment expenditure boost
capital expenditure difficult discern , possible expiration

that provision year-end could result fairly sharp slow investment , least
time . addition , recent discussion business contact , well range
statistical information , suggest persist tendency corporate executive
limit capital spending commitment . reason tendency unclear ,
continue focus corporate governance issue might still play role ,
business concern terrorism geopolitical risk might risen
year . member also note pace technological advance could
slow bit , trim rate decline cost capital high-tech
equipment software . High vacancy rate office building industrial
structure would likely continue weigh nonresidential investment , although
activity sector show sign revival .
Committee member interpret recent data anecdotal information indicate
growth consumer spending rebound fr om relatively slow rate
late spring . saw household spending likely continue expand
solid pace go forward . Gains nominal income , partly result gradual
increase employment , expect continue support consumer spending
low interest rate buoy residential investment . However , member perceive
several possible source downside risk household spending . particular ,
household might hold back spending attempt increase saving ,
fall low level relative income . ebb stimulus last
year-s tax cut also could tend slow growth consumer spending . failure
employment accelerate expect could undermine consumer confidence well
hold growth personal income .
regard external sector , foreign economy see generally
expand steadily , high level crude oil price apparently
restrain growth abroad somewhat less United States . Still , expectation
foreign economic growth marked somewhat , adverse
implication U.S . export overall U.S . growth . Indeed , policymakers
note domestic demand several major U.S . trading partner relatively
weak aggregate demand economy sustain
importantly export United States . pattern contribute
worrisome widen U.S . trade current account balance ,
Committee discuss significance wide external deficit various
adjustment might occur process return sustainable level .
Committee member generally view labor market condition improve
modestly late . Although payroll growth weak June July ,
register somewhat well performance August , initial claim
unemployment insurance continued hover around relatively low level .
member note mismatch demand supply certain type labor .
particular , unskilled worker say considerable difficulty find
job , firm face challenge hire worker specific skill ,
include truck driver heavy-equipment operator . Partly result , business
sector , transportation construction , reportedly
experience constraint output . Overall , however , slack appear
remain labor market . Looking forward , policymakers expect gradual
improvement labor market condition economy expand . However ,

anecdotal information suggest many firm remain quite cautious
expand payroll , cite , among factor , continued uncertainty
economic prospect high cost provide health care benefit .
Partly reflect likely persistence economic slack , member expect
inflation stay low . Although non-energy commodity price remain relatively
high , energy price decline noticeably record level recent week ,
effect energy price shock inflation expect wane .
regard , number policymakers comment data consumer producer
inflation generally come expectation intermeeting period ,
tend confirm Committee-s judgment upturn inflation earlier
year owe importantly temporary factor . Moreover , inflation expectation
appear well-contained , although expectation probably
condition part investors- anticipation stance monetary policy
would likely tighten time .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ,
member favor raise target federal fund rate 25 basis point 1Â¾
percent meeting . expansion evidently resilient self-sustaining
appear longer require unusual degree monetary stimulus
previously necessary . gradual increase interest rate seem likely
consistent continued solid economic growth would sufficient erode
remain margin slack resource utilization time . view
consideration , Committee believe another modest reduction degree
monetary policy accommodation today-s meeting warrant . today-s
action , real federal fund rate -- measure difference nominal
fund rate move average core PCE inflation -- would move slightly
positive territory .
regard Committee-s announcement release meeting ,
member agree statement indicate that , moderate earlier
year , partly response substantial rise energy price , output growth
appear regain traction labor market condition
improve modestly . addition , policymakers concur statement
indicate inflation inflation expectation ease recent month .
also agree characterize risk sustainable growth price stability
balance . Members comment recent evidence boost confidence
moderate economic growth would continue inflation would
contain . aggregate demand probably expand least rapidly
economy-s potential produce next several quarter , policymakers
continued see economic condition likely warrant reduction
policy accommodation come quarter . However , view many member ,
policy action would need increasingly keyed incoming data . Indeed ,
note market participant appear anticipate slow pace
policy firm long interpret removal policy
accommodation measure rate necessarily involve policy action
meeting .

At conclusion discussion , Committee vote authorize direct
Federal Reserve Bank New York , instruct otherwise , execute
transaction System Account accordance follow domestic policy
directive .
