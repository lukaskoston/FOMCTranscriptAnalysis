pace noticeably average rise previous twelve month . Also , price

of energy many commodity climbed sharply late , inflation
expectation appear risen slightly . economic growth continued
moderate come quarter , anticipate , pressure productive resource
would likely continue limit . participant expect that ,
allow possible near-term volatility related recent jump energy
commodity price , core inflation would probably remain around level
experienced average past year . However , recent development suggest
upside risk inflation risen somewhat since time March
meeting .

experienced steepest appreciation . Data home sale , permit , start
whole likewise suggest activity gradually diminishing . report

inventory unsold home still seem expand . Although fresh
comprehensive data available , home price average appear still
rising , slow pace past year . Going forward , growth
consumption spending likely support gain employment
personal income . slow appreciation home price effect
increase energy price interest rate already occur would likely

development mirror state level . precise reason
increase federal receipt entirely clear , robust income growth
probably important factor . case , effect trim current federal
budget deficit noticeably . Nonetheless , longer-run federal fiscal imbalance
remain serious concern .
Data economic growth outside United States indicate global
expansion firming , sense amplify report international contact .

apparent strengthen global growth likely support U.S . export
economic activity would also tend maintain upward pressure energy
commodity price .
Meeting participant express concern recent price development
implication inflation prospect . Core consumer inflation lately
little high expect . Moreover , energy price risen steeply period
since March meeting , and , although pass-through apparently limited
date , recent increase might reflect great degree core inflation
come month . Participants note price non-energy commodity ,
industrial metal building supply , also climb . recent decline
dollar another factor could add inflation pressure , although effect
prior change foreign exchange value dollar core consumer price
apparently limit . Business contact report continued shortage
certain type skilled labor related wage pressure occupation ,
would tend boost cost .
However , participant also cite factor could expect restrain
inflation . Although alternative measure labor compensation provide divergent
reading , growth total compensation balance appear remain moderate .
And , even nominal wage accelerate somewhat , relatively wide profit
margin could buffer effect price final good service . firm
would seek maintain margin , recent experience suggest might
accomplish part productivity gain , remain fairly
strong balance recent quarter , rather rapid price hike .
Participants discuss detail inflation expectation -- a potentially important
factor influence future inflation trend . survey suggest inflation
expectation risen recent week , others imply expectation
little change . Measures inflation compensation base difference
yield nominal Treasury security inflation-indexed issue edge high .
possible , though , investors- uncertainty regard inflation prospect ,
inflation expectation themselves , risen . balance , participant judged
inflation expectation risen somewhat -- a development would
take account policymaking warrant close monitoring -- but remain
contain .
Although Committee discuss policy approach range leave stance
policy unchanged meeting increase federal fund rate 50 basis
point , member believe additional 25 basis point firm policy
appropriate today keep inflation rise promote sustainable economic
expansion . Recent price development argue another firm step today-s
meeting . Core inflation recently bit high expect ,
several member remark core inflation around upper end
view acceptable range . Moreover , number factor augment
upside risk inflation : surge energy commodity price , recent
weakness foreign exchange value dollar , possibility
apparent increase inflation expectation could , persist , impart momentum
inflation . addition , economy appear operating relatively high level

of resource utilization grow quite strongly , whether economic
growth would moderate sustainable pace yet clear . time ,
member also saw downside risk economic activity . example , cumulative
effect past monetary policy action recent rise longer-term interest rate
housing activity price could turn large expect . Still ,
seem likely that , modest policy action , include 25 basis point
firm today , growth activity would moderate gradually come quarter ,
pressure resource would remain limit , core inflation would stay close
level experienced past year .
Given risk growth inflation , Committee member uncertain
much , any , tighten would need today-s action . view
risk outlook inflation could worsen , Committee decide repeat
indication policy statement release March meeting
policy firm could require . However , Committee agree
emphasize `` the extent timing firm depend importantly
evolution economic outlook imply incoming information . '' Members
debate appropriate characterization inflation expectation statement .
Low stable inflation expectation key attainment Committee-s
dual objective price stability maximum sustainable economic growth .
However , apparent pickup longer-term expectation , worrisome ,
relatively small . remain within range see past couple year ,
increase could well reverse long . Accordingly , appear appropriate
characterize inflation expectation `` contain . ''
conclusion discussion , Committee vote authorize direct
Federal Reserve Bank New York , instruct otherwise , execute
transaction System Account accordance follow domestic policy
