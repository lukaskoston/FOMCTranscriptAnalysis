increase somewhat year ahead . risk that , global
portfolio come increasingly weight toward dollar asset , expect return
asset would need rise attract world saving , much adjustment
potentially occur decline exchange rate dollar would
add pressure U.S . price .
Concerning outlook inflation , member continued see risk
primarily tilt toward rise inflationary pressure , though anticipate
gain productivity would hold increase unit labor cost
price , least nearer term . key issue whether growth aggregate
demand would moderate sufficiently least avoid great pressure
already tight labor market . regard , several cite recent statistical
anecdotal evidence large increase labor compensation , although unit labor
cost appear trend high point . However , nonlabor
input price already rise faster . prospect energy price
difficult predict , even price stabilize , passthrough
large earlier increase inflation wage expectation , well price
product heavily energy dependent , likely exert upward
pressure price throughout economy .

seem increase number exception , business contact continued
report raise price difficult carry successfully often
impossible . balance , outlook inflation remain subject marked degree
uncertainty . Given current level resource use strength economic
expansion relative growth economy-s long-run potential , however ,
member expect inflation pressure would gather momentum time
