increase first quarter rate somewhat Committee-s
annual range . Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued expand pace

staff forecast prepared meeting suggest expansion would

estimate potential . Growth private final demand would damped
anticipate wan positive wealth effect stem earlier large increase
equity price slow growth spending consumer durables , housing unit ,

Committee-s discussion current prospective economic development ,
member comment extend period forecaster
project slow economic growth high inflation actually
materialize . regard output , current indicator provide little evidence
moderation pace expansion robust growth experienced
average last year . Even so , member view slow rate
closer estimate growth economy-s potential reasonable
expectation . agree , however , timing extent moderation
subject wide range uncertainty . Factors expect foster slow growth
key demand sector economy include buildup large stock
business equipment , housing unit , durable good household
assumption stock market would play neutral role recent year .
effect domestic demand domestic production would continue
damped increase trade deficit , though offset source
might well diminish financial market economy key develop nation
exhibit sign stabilization improvement . Given persistence
robust growth domestic demand continue forward momentum U.S .
economic activity , many member comment risk forecast
tilt toward eventual emergence somewhat great inflation pressure .
Despite persistence tight labor market across nation , however ,

currently scatter indication rapid increase wage
evidence rise price inflation . reason underlie remarkable economic
performance potentially transitory also possibly longer-term nature .
Lower oil input price played role . However , also seem likely

Residential sale construction described strong many part

continue high level housing demand , especially single-family sector .
Relatively heavy spending import owe strong domestic demand low

seem present reduce threat nation-s trading partner . Even so , foreignsector forecast -- for industrial well emerge market economy -- remain
subject considerable downside risk , include uncertainty stem

Committee-s discussion outlook inflation , member comment
saw evidence acceleration price inflation despite continue
strength economic expansion tightness labor market . Anecdotal
report around nation continued underscore difficulty inability
business firm raise price highly competitive market .
limited number report relatively sizable increase wage paid worker
skill especially short supply , whole employer successful
hold increase labor compensation offset
improvement productivity . Indeed , increase unit labor cost , least
nonfinancial corporate sector perhaps widely well , decline
low rate past year .
member saw little reason anticipate significant , continue increase
inflation near term . Inflation expect rise , owe recent hike
oil price , increase limit . little evidence rise
pressure price early stage production nominal wage , inflation
remain contain time . However , member concerned
risk sustain rapid growth aggregate demand would stretch market even
more . Even presume growth economic activity would moderate pace
close economy-s potential , labor market would remain relatively taut
point could trigger faster increase labor compensation and , turn , rise
price inflation . Moreover , dissipation reversal favorable supply factors-including , example , addition energy price wan effect dollar-s
earlier appreciation -- could contribute high inflation expectation faster
nominal compensation increase . view others , though , impact

price unwind favorable factor might well mute offset
possible uptick productivity growth . Accelerating productivity
spur investment capacity intense competition among business ,
hold labor cost . Furthermore , optimism improve productivity
evident projection business profit high level equity price .
event , clear forecast recent year typically overstate rise
inflation , great deal uncertainty surround extent
productivity gain factor , unspecified , might continue hold
inflation period robust economic growth relatively tight labor market .
Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead ,
member indicate favor unchanged policy stance . Several comment
saw significant change tenor recent statistical anecdotal
report would constitute basis adjustment policy great
presumption policy might need change soon . Many refer particular
absence warn sign accelerate inflation near term
major consideration support steady policy time . view some ,
however , next policy action likely firm ease .
saw great likelihood tight -- and perhaps tightening -- labor market would add
price pressure demand would falter inflation would decrease
far . Yet recognize forecast subject substantial degree
uncertainty . argue cautious approach policy change , especially
light economic performance conform historical pattern
recent year . number member note case might make
unwind part Committee-s ease action fall last year , give
recovery financial market improvement economic outlook since
then , argue incoming data prospect sustain favorable
economic performance support action . member conclude
Committee position wait development unfold , especially give
absence evidence impend acceleration underlie inflation .
risk high inflation intensify , would still time take action head
price pressure order foster sustain economic growth high level
employment . Many member emphasize , however , circumstance
Committee might need act promptly forestall buildup inflationary force
could destabilize expansion .
member endorse proposal retain exist symmetry directive
respect possible adjustment policy intermeeting period .
many believe next policy move likely would direction
tightening , outcome foregone conclusion , event
timing next policy action highly uncertain . also note bias
directive would consistent members- view policy adjustment
unlikely period ahead . Moreover , Committee-s disclosure
procedure always require immediate announcement shift
symmetry , member agree announce shift tighten
bias , would likely current circumstance relatively pronounce
undesired effect financial market . particular , market might well build
