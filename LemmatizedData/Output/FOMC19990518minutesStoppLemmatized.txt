outlook net export continued subject downside risk , albeit
lesser extent late 1998 early 1999 .
Members express concern saw great risk rise
inflation even though current indicator continued whole point quiescent
wage price behavior . recent performance CPI industrial
commodity price numerous anecdotal report price cost
increase reason add caution outlook inflation , though
development still constitute tentative evidence possible change
inflation trend . Several member comment particular substantial weight

Unexpectedly large gain productivity contribute demand help

announce change meeting . Committee say would
