year likely outlook . view premise large measure
lag effect Committee-s relatively aggressive ease action year ,
include ease might adopt meeting , grow prospect
fiscal policy stimulus later year , generally favorable
effect still substantial productivity gain profit opportunity income
growth hence business household demand good service .
business profit stabilize final demand firm , inventory liquidation would
come end , add upward momentum economic activity . member
uncertain degree timing strengthen final demand ,
although relatively prompt strong rebound could rule out , many saw
variety factor point possibility upturn could weaker
delayed central tendency expectation . regard
outlook inflation , number member express concern tendency
measure inflation edge high year , many member expect
ease pressure labor product market already occur
likely continue month ahead would damp inflation go forward .
review development across nation , member refer quite sluggish

process might substantially complete much later year could
take even longer high-tech firm . evaluation assume continued sluggish
growth final demand period immediately ahead . Stronger growth ,
could rule out , would course bring inventory-sales ratio desire level
quickly .

development abroad . extent , economic difficulty foreign nation
occur concert soften activity United States , notable
weakness world high-tech market along downward adjustment equity
price globally represent downside risk factor worldwide . anticipate
recovery country would help strengthen many foreign economy
turn improve prospect U.S . export . Members note , however ,
nation persist structural problem present threat national economic
prosperity international trade . balance , external risk U.S .

System-s policy ease action foster strengthen economic expansion .
number member comment persist updrift key measure
core inflation become increasingly worrisome . regard , note
recent increase bond yield could represent rise long-term
inflation expectation . rise would entirely unexpected context
improve sentiment strength expansion , potentially adverse
implication cost cyclical weakness productivity , possibility
high energy price passthrough effect might persist longer
anticipate earlier . considerable extent , however , uptick inflation
expectation likely represent reversal anticipate decline inflation earlier
year economic prospect seem weaker survey data
confirm increase long-term inflation expectation . Moreover , measure

of core inflation accelerate ; particular , core PCE price inflation quite
stable twelve-month basis time .
Looking ahead , member foresee significant rise inflation likely
prospect . cite prevalence highly competitive condition market ,
continued make difficult business firm raise price despite
pressure period rise labor , energy , cost . Widespread
evidence lessen pressure labor market across nation
yet result low wage inflation , member expect recent
anticipate ebb pressure labor resource associate slack
product market period continue subpar economic growth , along
project decline energy price , would hold inflation forecast
horizon . Nonetheless , risk rise inflation . unexpectedly
strong rebound economic growth could begin put add upward pressure
price time labor market still tight historical standard
accelerate productivity longer held increase unit labor cost . Given
lag effectiveness monetary policy , pressure might materialize
effect countervail action Committee chance take hold .
Committee-s discussion policy forthcoming intermeeting period ,
one member indicate could support proposal call
ease reserve condition consistent 50 basis point reduction
federal fund rate level 4 percent . One member express strong preference
25 basis point reduction two others indicate could accepted
limited ease move . Despite somewhat differ preference ,
member agree ease desirable light view
continue weakness economy , absence evidence growth
stabilize rebound , still decidedly downside risk
economic expansion . member note that , although policy ease
substantially , might still consider marginally accommodative
relation force damp aggregate demand . Accordingly , action
contemplate today need provide adequate stimulus economy
whose outlook significant strengthen remain tenuous climate fragile
business consumer confidence . Members note lag effect
monetary policy ease implement earlier year still hard discern ,
though felt increasingly year ahead . regard risk
rise inflation could dismiss , risk appear quite
limited nearer term , excessive monetary stimulus avoid avert
rise inflation expectation add inflation pressure time . Members
prefer could support 25 basis point ease action give particular emphasis
desirability point take signal cautious approach
policy , relative 50 basis point federal fund rate reduction Committee
implementing , give lag effect substantial reduction federal
fund rate date , accompany buildup liquidity , related risk
aggressive ease action would increase odds overly accommodative
policy stance rise inflationary pressure future .
member accepted proposal include press statement release
meeting sentence indicate Committee continued regard

risk economic outlook tilt toward weakness even today-s
ease action . Forecasts growth business earnings spending continued
revise down , process end , weakness demand seem
main threat satisfactory economic performance . time member
anticipate neutral balance risk statement could appropriate long ,
probably well substantial evidence emerge economic growth
strengthen appreciably , Committee could see policy ease
enough promote future return maximum sustainable economic growth .
Indeed , clear much federal fund rate might
reduce today absence significantly adverse shock ,
member note end ease process might near . Even so ,
economy perhaps still midst process weaken growth aggregate
demand unknown persistence dimension , member generally agree that ,
give prevail uncertainty , would premature Committee shift
balance risk statement time .
