Review Monetary Policy Strategy , Tools ,
Communication Practices
Committee participant continued discussion related ongoing review Federal Reserve-s
monetary policy strategy , tool , communication
practice . Staff briefing provide assessment
range monetary policy tool Committee could
employ provide additional economic stimulus
bolster inflation outcome , particularly future episode policy rate would constrain
effective low bound ( ELB ) . staff first discuss policy rate tool , focus three form forward guidanceâqualitative , provide nonspecific indication expect duration accommodation ; date-based , specifies date beyond
accommodation could start reduce ; outcomebased , tie possible start reduction accommodation achievement certain macroeconomic outcome . briefing address communication challenge associate form forward
guidance , include need avoid convey
negative economic outlook FOMC expect .
Nonetheless , staff suggest forward guidance
generally effective ease financial condition stimulate economic activity circumstance
policy rate ELB
ELB . briefing also discuss negative interest
rate , policy option implement several foreign
central bank . staff note although evidence far suggest tool provide accommodation jurisdiction employ , also indication possible adverse
side effect . Moreover , difference U.S . financial system financial system jurisdiction suggest foreign experience may
provide useful guide assess whether negative
rate would effective United States .
second part staff briefing focus balance
sheet policy tool . staff discuss benefit
cost associate large-scale asset purchase program implement Federal Reserve financial crisis . general , staffâs review historical experience suggest benefit large-scale
asset purchase program significant many
potential cost program identify
time either materialize materialize
small degree initially fear . addition , staff
presentation note thatâtaking account investor expectation ahead announcement new programâthe effect asset purchase appear
diminish materially across consecutive program .

However , go forward , policy might
effective longer-term interest rate would likely
much low onset future asset purchase
program financial crisis .
staff also compare benefit cost associate
asset purchase program fix cumulative size flow-basedâwhere purchase continue specific pace certain macroeconomic outcome achievedâand examine potential effectiveness use asset purchase place
ceiling interest rate . briefing also discuss
lending program could facilitate flow credit
household business .
Participants discuss relative merit qualitative ,
date-based , outcome-based forward guidance .
number participant note three
form forward guidance could effective provide accommodation , depend circumstance
away ELB . also suggest
different type forward guidance would likely
need address vary economic condition ,
communication regard forward guidance need
tailor explain Committeeâs evaluation
economic outlook . particular , several participant
emphasize guard possibility adverse feedback loop forward guidance interpret public sign sharply deteriorate
economic outlook , thus lead household business become even cautious spending
decision , Committee would need clearly communicate announce policy could help promote
well economic outcome . Participants saw benefit cost associate outcome-based forward
guidance relative form forward guidance .
one hand , relative qualitative date-based
forward guidance , outcome-based forward guidance
advantage create explicit link future
monetary policy action macroeconomic condition ,
thereby help support economic stabilization effort foster transparency accountability .
hand , outcome-based forward guidance could
complex difficult explain and , hence , could potentially less effective qualitative date-based
forward guidance hurdle could overcome . participant comment outcomebased forward guidance , tie inflation outcome ,
could useful tool reinforce Committeeâs commitment symmetric 2 percent objective .
Participants also discuss benefit cost use different type balance sheet policy . Participants

generally agree balance sheet policy implement Federal Reserve crisis ease
financial condition contribute economic recovery , tool become important part Committeeâs current toolkit . However , participant point research
produce sizable range estimate magnitude
economic effect balance sheet action . addition , participant note effectiveness
tool might diminish future , longerterm interest rate decline low level
would likely even low follow adverse shock
could lead resumption large-scale asset
purchase ; result , might limited scope
balance sheet tool provide accommodation . Several
participant comment advantage disadvantage flow-based asset purchase program tie
achievement economic outcome . one
hand , program adjust automatically response
performance economy and , hence ,
straightforward implement communicate .
hand , flow-based asset purchase program
may result balance sheet rise undesirable level . participant also comment that , bar significant dislocation particular segment market , would restrict asset purchase Treasury security avoid perception Federal Reserve
engage credit allocation across sector
economy .
consider policy tool Federal Reserve
use recent past , participant discuss
benefit cost use balance sheet tool cap
rate short- long-maturity Treasury security
open market operation necessary .
participant saw benefit cap longer-term interest
rate directly influence household business spending . addition , cap longer-maturity interest rate use balance sheet tool , judged credible market participant , might require small
amount asset purchase provide similar amount
accommodation quantity-based program purchasing longer-maturity security . However , many participant raise concern cap long-term rate .
participant note uncertainty regard neutral federal fund rate regard
effect rate ceiling policy future interest rate
inflation make difficult determine appropriate
level rate ceiling ceiling
remove ; maintain rate ceiling could result
elevate level Federal Reserveâs balance sheet

significant volatility size maturity composition ; manage longer-term interest rate might
see interact federal debt management
process . contrast , majority participant saw
great benefit use balance sheet tool cap
shorter-term interest rate reinforce forward guidance near-term path policy rate .
participant judged negative interest rate currently appear attractive monetary policy
tool United States . Participants comment
limited scope bring policy rate negative territory , evidence beneficial effect
negative interest rate abroad mixed ,
unclear effect negative rate might
willingness financial intermediary lend
spending plan household business . Participants note negative interest rate would entail
risk introduce significant complexity distortion
financial system . particular , participant
caution financial system United States
considerably different country implement negative interest rate policy , negative rate could significant adverse effect
market function financial stability
abroad . Notwithstanding consideration , participant rule possibility circumstance
could arise might appropriate reassess
potential role negative interest rate policy
tool .
Overall , participant generally agree forward
guidance balance sheet policy follow Federal Reserve financial crisis effective
provide stimulus ELB . estimate
equilibrium real interest rate decline notably
recent decade , policymakers saw less room reduce federal fund rate support economy
event downturn . addition , background inflation undershoot symmetric 2 percent objective several year , participant raise
concern scope reduce federal fund
rate provide support economic activity future
recession could reduce inflation shortfall
continued lead decline inflation expectation .
Therefore , participant generally agree important
Committee keep wide range tool available
employ appropriate support economy . would help ensure anchor inflation expectation level consistent Committeeâs symmetric 2 percent inflation objective .

Review Options Repo Operations Support
Control Federal Funds Rate
staff briefed participant recent experience
use repo operation support control federal fund rate possibly maintain role
repo operation monetary policy implementation
framework longer run . Ongoing capacity
repo operation could view useful amplereserves regime way provide insurance
unexpected stress money market could drive
federal fund rate outside Committeeâs target
range sustain period . staff present two
potential approach conduct repo operation
Committee decide maintain ongoing role
operation . first approach , Desk
would conduct modestly size , relatively frequent repo
operation design provide high degree readiness need large operation arise ;
second approach , FOMC would establish
stand fixed-rate facility could serve automatic money market stabilizer.8 Assessing two approach involve several consideration , include
degree assurance control federal fund
rate , likelihood participation Federal Reserveâs repo operation could become stigmatize ,
possibility operation could encourage Federal Reserveâs counterparties take excessive liquidity risk portfolio , potential disintermediation financial transaction currently undertaken
private counterparties . Regular , modestly size repo operation likely would pose relatively little risk stigma
moral hazard , may provide less assurance
control federal fund rate might
difficult Federal Reserve anticipate money
staff briefed Committee June 2019 possible
role stand repo facility monetary policy implementation framework .

market pressure scale repo operation accordingly . stand fixed-rate repo facility would
likely provide substantial assurance control
federal fund rate , use facility could become
stigmatize , particularly rate set relatively
high level . Conversely , stand facility rate set
relatively low level could result large
frequent repo operation would appropriate .
effectively stand ready provide form
liquidity as-needed basis , facility could increase risk institution may take undesirably high amount liquidity risk .
comment follow staff presentation , participant emphasize importance maintain reserve level consistent Committeeâs choice
ample-reserves monetary policy implementation
framework , control level federal
fund rate exercise primarily set
Federal Reserveâs administer rate
active management supply reserve require . participant indicate that , environment , would tolerance allow
federal fund rate vary day day
move occasionally outside target range , especially
instance associate easily identifiable technical event ; couple participant express discomfort miss .
Participants express range view relative
merit two approach described staff
conduct repo operation . Many participant note
that , ample supply reserve firmly establish , might little need stand repo facility frequent repo operation .
participant indicate basic principle implement ample-reserves framework maintain reserve ongoing basis level would obviate
need open market operation address pressure funding market exceptional circumstance . Many participant remark , however ,
even environment ample reserve , stand
facility could serve useful backstop support control federal fund rate event outsized

stand repo facility , additional work would necessary ass likely implication different design
choice stand repo facility , pricing , eligible counterparties , set acceptable collateral .
Echoing issue raise Committeeâs June 2019
meeting , various participant comment need
carefully evaluate design choice guard
potential moral hazard , stigma , disintermediation
