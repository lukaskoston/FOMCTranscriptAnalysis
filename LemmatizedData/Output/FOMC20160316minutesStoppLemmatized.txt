2016 2017 would converge toward longerrun rate 2018 ( table 1 figure 1 ) . participant
project end current year , unemployment rate would decline to , fall below , individual estimate longer-run normal unemployment rateâthat be , project unemployment gap
would zero negativeâand zero negative gap would persist 2018 , even though
many participant reduce estimate longerrun normal rate . participant project inflation ,
measure four-quarter change price index personal consumption expenditure ( PCE ) ,
would pick 2016 2017 low rate
