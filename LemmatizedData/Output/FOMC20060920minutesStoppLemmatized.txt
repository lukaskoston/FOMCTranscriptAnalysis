2008 . Many participant also note core inflation run

wage , particularly certain type professional skilled worker and ,
area , unskilled worker .
One participant highlight that , staff forecast , labor force growth would begin
slow next year member baby-boom generation
retire . Even resource utilization rate unchanged , slow growth labor
force would mean increase employment would significantly low ,
average , register recent year . case , slow growth
labor force employment imply expansion potential GDP could
somewhat low earlier decade . participant comment ,
however , view potential output growth , well expansion actual
output , likely remain solid next several year .
Many meeting participant emphasize continued quite concerned
outlook inflation . Recent rate core inflation , persist ,
see high consistent price stability , participant underscored
importance ensure moderation inflation . sure , recent data
inflation suggest improvement situation late spring , partly
reflect slow increase owners- equivalent rent . Also , considerably low
level energy price recent week , sustain , would help reduce overall
inflation damp increase core price . Moreover , business would meet
resistance attempt pas cost increase less robust economic
circumstance likely prevail least time . However , energy price
remain quite sensitive wide range force , include geopolitical
development , might well rebound . date , available evidence indicate
inflation expectation remain contain -- indeed , expectation price increase
next year fall energy price decline . Nonetheless , several
participant worried inflation expectation could rise Federal Reserve-s
willingness carry intention seek price stability could call
question cost price pressure mount even moderation
core inflation . Looking forward , participant thought likely
outcome reduction inflation pressure , anticipate decline
gradual uncertainty around forecast skewed toward high rather
low inflation rate .
Committee-s discussion monetary policy intermeeting period , nearly
member favor keep target federal fund rate 5-1/4 percent
meeting . Members generally expect economic activity expand pace
rate growth potential output near term strengthen

over time . Moreover , give uncertainty forecasting , significantly
sluggish performance anticipate could entirely rule out . Although
uncertainty substantial , core inflation seem likely ebb gradually
elevate level , part owe wan effect past increase energy
price . anticipate expansion economic activity pace slightly
rate growth economy-s potential would likely also play role ease
pressure resource . Members note certain development late-appreciable decline energy price , softer indicator economic activity ,
slightly low reading core inflation -- point modestly well inflation
outlook hence make policy decision today somewhat less difficult
August , see particularly close call .
view recent information economy , member agree
appropriate post-meeting statement characterize economic growth
apparently continue moderate . However , view still-high energy
commodity price elevate rate resource utilization well recent
indication possible acceleration labor cost , member continued see
substantial risk inflation would decline anticipate Committee .
Consequently , Committee agree statement cite risk
inflation explicitly reference possibility additional policy firming .
