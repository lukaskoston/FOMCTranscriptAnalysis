comment development key sector economy , meeting
participant note that , relative several month ago , many firm seem
somewhat confident economic outlook . anticipation increase
sale relative exist production capacity also desire upgrade technology
improve competitiveness lead firm increase spending equipment
software . Gains capital spending quite strong last year ,
spending might motivate year-end expiration partialexpensing provision tax code , participant see little evidence date
would significant slowdown growth spending early part
2005 . Low longer-term interest rate corporate borrowing -- reflect part narrow
credit risk spread -- along strong corporate profitability improve balance
sheet continue support fairly brisk growth capital expenditure . Low
longer-term nominal interest rate partly attributable well-contained inflation
expectation , low real interest rate , along slight decline equity price far
year , might reflect linger caution part business outlook .
Nevertheless , narrow credit spread risk premium , along abundant liquidity
financing market , suggest market assign fairly low odds significant
downside risk .
Solid income gain , low interest rate , consumer confidence see
participant help sustain strong growth household spending . firm
report holiday sale high year earlier well expect ,
auto sale respond strongly incentive December . current low
measure save rate seem mostly explainable strength expect income
gain , low interest rate , increase household wealth result rise
equity housing price . Although save rate might well drift next
couple year , participant generally thought likely consumer spending would
continue grow strong pace . However , marked slow home price

appreciation possible increase longer-term interest rate , would raise
financing cost reduce opportunity extract equity home
refinancings home equity loan , see downside risk prospect
consumption spending housing construction .
Several participant mention low level measure national saving ,
imply continued need foreign financing U.S . investment , imbalance
external sector impart additional uncertainty longer-term economic outlook .
extent federal budget deficit would decline come year
open question . regard current account balance , participant note
sharp drop net export November probably reflect transitory factor large part ,
well report measurement error . However , little hard evidence
yet strengthen growth spending foreign trading partner
substantial effect net export previous dollar decline . result , external
imbalance seem likely remain elevate , high level uncertainty
surround prospect path adjustment .
number participant note continued modest gain employment , though
comment that , base anecdotal information , job growth seem picked
late . increase aggregate demand expect sufficient come
quarter allow rate unemployment continue edge low even
people return labor force . Participants note considerable uncertainty
sustainable rate resource utilization structural productivity growth . One
participant suggest that , give range uncertainty , output might already
close potential . Others comment recent study balance support
conclusion structural labor market shift cause resource slack low
commonly estimate flat pattern growth wage compensation
suggest absence pressure labor market . However , unit labor cost
accelerate 2004 owe taper productivity growth . slow
reflect moderation structural productivity growth firm believe
associate increase growth rate labor cost permanent , cost
pressure might pass consumer price fairly quickly preserve profit
margin . participant generally felt pace underlie productivity
growth remain robust , careful attention would need paid development
regard unit labor cost profit margin .
Despite pickup cost , participant thought rate core inflation likely
would remain low stable , assume removal policy accommodation .
Elevated price markup profit , well slack resource use , help absorb
cost increase put downward pressure inflation would likely continue
so . Indeed , core inflation measure ease off , late reading
balance second half 2004 relative first half . However , several
participant suggest possibility upward skew distribution inflation
outcome , especially appreciable decline foreign exchange
value dollar structural productivity growth ; already participant
hearing anecdotal report firm increase ability pas cost increase
product price , perhaps increase confidence outlook
economic expansion .

In Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period , member
favor raise target federal fund rate 25 basis point 2-1/2 percent
meeting . member judged quarter-point firm target
federal fund rate appropriate light current overall accommodative financial
condition continue outlook solid economic growth diminish slack
resource utilization . high nominal federal fund rate see need
contain risk increase cost price pressure , even action , real
federal fund rate generally see remain level might reasonably
associate maintain stable inflation rate medium run . pace
policy move upcoming meeting , however , would depend incoming data .
regard Committee-s announcement release meeting ,
member concur overall economic prospect similar prevail
time December meeting consequently statement alter
minor extent require reflect recent economic development .
concur statement note output appear grow
moderate pace despite rise energy price , labor market condition continued
improve gradually , inflation longer-term inflation expectation remain
well-contained . also agree characterize risk sustainable growth
price stability balance . member agree FOMC statement
meeting indicate policy accommodation could remove pace
likely measure Committee would respond change
economic prospect need maintain price stability .
conclusion discussion , Committee vote authorize direct
Federal Reserve Bank New York , instruct otherwise , execute
transaction System Account accordance follow domestic policy
directive :
`` The Federal Open Market Committee seek monetary financial condition
foster price stability promote sustainable growth output . longrun objective , Committee immediate future seek condition reserve
