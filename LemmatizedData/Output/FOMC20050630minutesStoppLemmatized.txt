Several meeting participant express concern domestic global

tax receipt recent month . deficit contribute low level
national save would , correct time , ultimately constrain
investment overall economic growth . Moreover , U.S . trade deficit expect
remain large go forward , reflect low level U.S . save
relatively slow growth trading partner . Uncertainties regard
nature timing potential correction imbalance complicate
assessment intermediate-term prospect U.S . economy .
discussion development asset market , participants- comment
focus two related issue : low level long-term interest rate
continued run-up home price . Despite substantial cumulative policy tighten
past year , long-term Treasury yield move considerably low ,
imply significant flatten yield curve ( measure spread
long-term short-term Treasury yield ) . Lower compensation inflation
account portion decline longer-term nominal yield , large
portion reflect reduction real yield . Participants cite variety factor
possibly contribute unusual behavior long-term rate period .
one , investor might marked level real interest rate see likely
necessary contain inflation keep output line potential -- perhaps
reflect weak investment demand abroad relative save -- or even might
come expect stretch sub-par U.S . growth . However , anticipation slow growth
seem inconsistent high stock price thin risk spread corporate debt
market . behavior long-term interest rate could also reflect reduce
uncertainty part investor economic outlook -- see low
reading imply volatility bond equity market . Finally , demand longerterm U.S . security domestic foreign investor might boost
special factor . Confidence economic outlook low market interest
rate -- along possibly outsized expectation capital gain markets-could also help account high level home price Committee
discuss first day meeting . agree considerable uncertainty
attend outlook long-term interest rate home price .
regard role monetary policy respond possible imbalance
housing bond market , meeting participant stress importance pursuit

of core objective price stability maximum sustainable economic growth .
extent asset price movement threaten achievement
objective , would course take consideration set policy . However ,
give unavoidable uncertainty associate judgment regard
appropriate level likely future movement asset price , strategy
respond directly possible mispricing see unlikely
contribute , balance , achievement Committee-s objective time .
Participants- view inflation outlook mixed . Thus far 2005 , core
consumer price inflation high participant expect
start year , reflect , least part , pass-through effect high energy ,
commodity , import price . shock could expect boost inflation
temporarily , participant express concern that , policy still
accommodative , underlie pace inflation might process step
up , perhaps level upper end range view
compatible Committee-s price stability objective . degree slack
remain labor resource market uncertain , unit labor cost
nonfarm business sector move notably high recent quarter . Trend unit
labor cost could also boost slow growth structural productivity ;
recent evidence conclusive , participant thought underlie pace
productivity growth might well fall back come quarter follow substantial
gain see recent year . high energy price already eat profit
margin firm outside energy sector , increase unit labor cost might
likely pass price .
agree inflation development watch carefully ,
meeting participant emphasize recent core inflation data relatively
restrain , anecdotal report suggest pricing power many firm
remain quite limit . Moreover , reading future market suggest oil
price would likely flatten out , effect inflation gradually ebb .
Similarly , price commodity import , surge time ,
moderating . Survey market measure long-term inflation expectation
suggest earlier high inflation reading go persist . Finally ,
degree slack labor market uncertain , total labor compensation
probably boost temporarily around turn year special factor ,
recent behavior range indicator labor cost appear
consistent remain slack would likely tend restrain inflation
pressure . Moreover , anecdotal report labor market condition continued point
shortage labor certain , mostly skilled , occupation .
Committee-s discussion monetary policy meeting , member
agree 25 basis point increase target federal fund rate 3-1/4 percent .
Economic growth remain firm , rise energy , possibly labor , cost
threaten put upward pressure inflation . Even action , federal
fund rate remain level member anticipate would prove necessary
long run contain inflation pressure keep output near potential . However ,
pace extent future policy move would depend incoming data .

In consider statement release follow meeting , member
concur note even rise oil price , expansion
remain firm labor market continued improve gradually . also thought
statement note continued pressure inflation ,
mention long-term inflation expectation remain well contain .
policy still see accommodative , member agree statement retain
assessment risk sustainable economic growth price stability
balance , conditional appropriate policy action . Members also agree
statement language indicate `` policy accommodation remove
pace likely measure '' correctly characterize outlook policy
now . member concur stage expansion , margin
slack resource narrow inflation somewhat high , Committee need
particularly alert sign increase inflation . increase could
particularly problematic might impart upward momentum inflation
expectation would costly reverse . case , additional tighten would
probably necessary , view differ amount tighten would
likely require keep inflation contain bring output line potential .
However , member agree need make assessment
time , appropriate pace degree cumulative policy adjustment
would depend economic development go forward . forward-looking
language statement clearly condition outlook , see
limit Committee-s flexibility respond development .
