balance supply demand , evidently risen enough

associate upcoming century date change , member saw sign
significant slow aggregate demand next month . somewhat
longer horizon , however , believe growth aggregate demand likely
moderate sustainable pace would bring closer balance
expansion aggregate supply . Key factor cite member support

extent already evident effect rise occur long-term interest

depreciation dollar ongoing strengthen many foreign economy

forecast subject substantial degree uncertainty , risk
balance see tilt toward growth strong enough put add pressure
already tight labor market . Increasing pressure labor resource ,
materialize , would point foster large increase labor cost ,
potentially adverse implication price inflation time .

Members anticipate dollar-s recent depreciation strengthen
foreign economy would foster significant pickup export . Indeed ,
available data anecdotal report around country indicate foreign
demand already improve markedly U.S . product .
circumstance , domestic demand would need decelerate considerably growth
proceed sustainable pace .
Concerning outlook inflation , member note despite long duration
tight labor market across nation , labor compensation increase
slightly low rate year consumer price inflation remain moderate ,
albeit year-earlier level owe sharp rise energy price .
deceleration labor compensation may induced large measure
low level consumer price inflation 1998 . addition , major factor underlie
persistence generally subdue price inflation period robust economic
expansion continued acceleration productivity , clearly hold
increase unit production cost . latter contribute ongoing
competitive pressure severely limited ability firm raise price , help
point keep inflation low level .
member nonetheless remain concerned outlook inflation .
continued focus especially possibility anticipate moderation
growth aggregate demand , take account outlook rise foreign
demand U.S . good service , might sufficient avoid add pressure

on labor resource . sure , economy-s potential output appear
expand briskly , much impetus provide accelerate
productivity . Even so , pool unemployed worker willing take job
continued drawn down , seem likely many member prospective
growth aggregate demand might generate increase pressure economy-s
ability produce good service thus add inflationary pressure
time . concern heighten prospect number development
tend contain inflation last year reversing .
Members mention particular likelihood increase labor compensation
might head high lag response pickup consumer price inflation
year . Also likely add labor cost pressure relatively large advance
cost health care benefit possibility high minimum wage .
Moreover , turnaround energy import price could tend feed
directly price U.S.-produced good raise cost reduce
competitive pressure hold price . Strengthening demand around world
already seem contribute high price material nonlabor
input production `` pipeline . '' general , however , member anticipate
pickup inflation likely gradual , cost pressure quite
possibly continue held largely check time improve
productivity trend . recognize forecast rise inflation fail
materialize recent year , raise question understand
empirical specification relationship currently underlie inflation
process . balance , though , unsustainable pace economic expansion along
reversal factor previously held overall price increase
suggest significant risk inflation would strengthen time give prevail
financial condition .
background , member support raise Committee-s target
federal fund rate 25 basis point meeting . Views differ
extent outlook inflation policy go forward . However , tighten
resource constraint indicate unsustainable growth , tentative sign
growth might slowing , various factor damp price
turn around , member agree need slight tighten
meeting raise odds contain inflation forestall inflationary
imbalance would undercut favorable performance economy .
view reinforce prospect Committee might find desirable
adjust policy December meeting tighten action could add
potential financial uncertainty unsettlement surround century date
change . Accordingly , action might wait meeting early
February , member agree risk wait extend
period unacceptably high .
member accepted proposal adopt symmetric directive . directive
view consistent Committee-s current expectation
policy move likely consider Committee-s meeting February .
circumstance , Committee decision retain exist asymmetry toward
tighten could well send mislead signal probability near-term
action unsettle effect financial market time concern
relate century date change might add normal year-end pressure .

note previously , however , view differ degree regard subsequent
outlook policy . basis currently available information , number
member indicate quite uncertain possible need
tighten action come month keep inflation within acceptable limit .
Continued favorable price unit cost data , driven part improve
productivity , suggest action depend incoming
information economic activity , pressure resource , inflation .
member , emphasize persistently strong growth economic activity
unusually high level labor resource utilization , suggest additional firm
stance policy probably would necessary keep inflation check hence
maintain favorable backdrop maximum economic growth . However , view
question surround outlook , amount firm already undertaken
Committee year include meeting uncertain effect ,
special situation financial market year-end , support adoption
symmetric directive .
