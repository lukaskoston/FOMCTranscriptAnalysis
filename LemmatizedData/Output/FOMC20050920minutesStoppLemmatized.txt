discussion economic situation outlook , meeting participant agree
output employment appear grow good pace
Hurricane Katrina-s landfall . Business fix investment little softer
expect , household spending especially strong . Participants agree
widespread devastation Gulf Coast region dislocation many
people would hold indicator spending time . also
view aggregate demand output would likely rebound long , fuel
part private spending rebuild outlay federal government assist
recovery . growth economy expect recover , meeting participant
concerned price pressure , elevate storm ,
could climb far , primarily result additional increase energy price .
Meeting participant recognize Hurricane Katrina would significant effect
U.S . economy , size timing effect uncertain .
Economic activity Gulf Coast region would disrupt destruction
capital displacement large population , perhaps extend period .
Moreover , damage infrastructure extract processing oil natural gas
expect substantial , significant near-term implication energy
price national economy , project track Hurricane Rita raise
additional concern . environment , price crude oil , natural gas ,
gasoline likely would remain elevate subject considerable volatility ,
particularly give limited spare capacity available energy extraction
refining industry . Participants note substantial rebuild would
probably underway soon , support importantly government program .
pace reconstruction activity would take place , however , uncertain ,
depend part factor still difficult ass , quickly
affected area could make habitable . balance , participant thought
would likely significant shift timing aggregate economic activity
next several quarter probably little effect economy-s
intermediate-term growth prospect . Several participant voiced concern
effect hurricane likely add already considerable pressure
price .
nation whole , participant note household spending fairly
robust hurricane , support strong advance income continue

gain wealth reflect part large increase home price .
anecdotal information support indication available data activity
housing market generally remain brisk . termination inducement
purchase motor vehicle expect retard expenditure consumer durables
latter part year . reduction real disposable income cause
large increase consumer energy price also anticipate restrain consumer
spending , business contact indicate retail outlet typically serve
lower- middle-income household could see particular weakness . reduction
spending result high energy price hurricane-related dislocation
could augment weaken consumer attitude . Many restrain
effect thought likely dissipate time , however . Retail energy price
likely retrace least portion post-hurricane increase , consumer
confidence rebound . Moreover , demand consumer durables , well
housing , would receive support hurricane victim repair replace lose
property , help insurance payment government transfer . Although
uncertainty outlook spending increase , appear that ,
time , consumption would probably expand moderate pace -- perhaps little
pace income growth increase house price slow
historically typical rate .
Meeting participant note that , even prior hurricane , business fix
investment somewhat weaker expect . softness somewhat
puzzling , sale growing , business balance sheet appear quite strong
aggregate , profitability high , financing readily available relatively
inexpensive firm . Although apparent sluggishness could reflect
short-term fluctuation volatile data series , evidence suggest may
also stem concern among business executive effect high
energy price . anecdotal information commercial real estate market
mixed , district reporting firm market activity elsewhere
say remain subpar .
regard fiscal policy , meeting participant note federal outlay would
increase sharply order assist recovery reconstruction effort
aftermath hurricane . eventual size increment federal outlay
unclear , likely quite large . substantial step-up government
spending would add federal deficit already large underscored
worrisome loss fiscal discipline evident recent year . expansion federal
spending imply increase fiscal stimulus time margin
unutilized resource overall economy probably thin .
Participants- concern inflation prospect generally increase
intermeeting period . surge energy price , particular , boost overall
inflation , increase would probably pas time core
price . pose risk could persistent influence inflation
inflation expectation rise . Indeed , recent survey evidence
expectation troubling , widen federal deficit mention
factor could stir inflationary concern . Measures labor cost
give conflict signal , index indicate growth labor
compensation remain relatively low another show appreciably rapid

increase . Anecdotal information continued point shortage certain type
labor , truck driver , business contact report difficulty hire
generally , development prompt firm boost wage .
Underlying productivity growth date apparently remain robust but ,
stage business cycle , gain productivity could necessarily count
stay strong . price number intermediate good , include wide range
petrochemical product building material , subject upward pressure ,
reflect high crude oil price , production disruption energy sector ,
elevate demand material anticipation rebuild Gulf Coast region .
Still , core inflation recent month quite damped , market-based
measure longer-term inflation expectation risen modestly late .
observe that , early 1980s , pass-through energy price core
inflation quite limit , suggest that , current circumstance , core
inflation could stay relatively low overall inflation would probably drop back
inflation expectation remain contain .
Committee-s discussion monetary policy intermeeting period , nearly
member favor raise target federal fund rate 25 basis point 3-3/4
percent meeting . Although uncertainty increase , Committee-s
judgment fundamental factor influence longer-term path economy
probably affected hurricane , upside risk inflation
appear increase . Even today-s action , federal fund rate would
likely level would necessary contain inflationary pressure ,
rate increase probably would require . Moreover , uncertainty
near-term economic prospect result Hurricane Katrina would
probably reduce materially come week . Indeed , underlie economic
trend would particularly difficult ass next several month
result direct , presumably temporary , effect storm aftermath
incoming data . pause policy tighten meeting potential
mislead public Committee-s perception fundamental
strength resilience economy commitment foster price
stability .
discuss statement release meeting , member agree
would appropriate characterize macroeconomic effect Hurricane
Katrina , significant , essentially temporary . Members also believe
statement note monetary policy accommodation robust
underlie productivity growth continue support economic activity .
Although energy price potential add inflation pressure , inflation
expectation recently exhibit sign increase , member agree
risk inflation , well growth , remain essentially balance
assumption appropriate policy action . Committee also agree reiterate
previous expectation `` . . . policy accommodation remove pace
likely measure . '' However , sentiment express consider change
forward-looking aspect statement upcoming meeting , part
considerable reduction monetary policy accommodation already
accomplish .
