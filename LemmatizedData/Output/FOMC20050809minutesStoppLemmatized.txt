participant note aggregate spending appear picked recent
month anticipate current estimate slack narrower
review June meeting . addition , high rise energy price

would feed through , least temporarily , core measure inflation . Nonetheless ,
core inflation recently relatively low inflation expectation remain
well contain . Moreover , participant thought slow final sale
likely later year net export resume decline purchase
automobile fell back expiration special discount program .
circumstance , appear that , now , continued removal policy accommodation
measure pace still would likely sufficient keep inflation contain ,
participant also recognize pace cumulative extent policy adjustment
go forward would depend importantly economic development .
household sector , path spending expect bolster
near term still-low interest rate , solid growth disposable income , ongoing
increase wealth . However , elevate energy price see likely
significant drag consumption and , net , household spending expect
advance moderate pace . Housing sale construction activity generally
remain strong across country , meeting participant note anecdotal

margin , high level liquid asset , see support expenditure

software equipment go forward . Inventory investment decline second
quarter , much falloff concentrate motor vehicle industry ,

investor dependency Committee-s policy expectation economic
data continue foster inappropriate degree risk-taking financial
market . Another participant mention , however , recent sluggish growth
monetary aggregate suggest stance policy overly
accommodative . Moreover , high proportion mortgage tie shortterm rate , note increase short-term rate could somewhat
larger-than-usual effect spending . balance , current financial condition ,
embed expectation future policy tightening , generally see likely
consistent sustain moderate economic growth containment pressure
inflation come quarter .
Regarding federal budget , recent narrow deficit note ,
improvement appear attributable cyclical factor increase
level tax collection likely repeat . sign evident
great fiscal discipline budget process would emerge time soon .

attributable special factor . Continued brisk import growth appear likely
sustain foreseeable future gain domestic demand .
Participants discuss length factor affect cost price . Although
uncertainty underlie pace productivity increase , trend labor
force participation , level potential output complicate inflation outlook ,
high energy price reduce resource slack see point elevate
inflation pressure . recent monthly reading indicate core inflation
subdue , number participant note underlie core inflation appear
run pace around upper end range view consistent
price stability-an assessment reinforce recent upward revision
historical data core PCE inflation . Participants comment increase
inflation recent rate could especially adverse effect longer-run
economic performance .

intermeeting period , many also cite factor that , concert likely continued
removal policy accommodation , would tend hold inflation pressure check .

For example , indication emerge recently business enjoy
significant increase pricing power , continue expansion global trade
see important factor limit firms- ability pas cost increase .
circumstance markup relatively high level , substantial
proportion increase business cost might well reflect narrower
profit margin . Moreover , recent relatively low monthly reading core inflation
modest wage pressure , least measure , suggest slack
remain resource utilization . Despite rise oil price quicken pace
economic activity , market- survey-based measure inflation expectation
seem remain quite well anchor .
