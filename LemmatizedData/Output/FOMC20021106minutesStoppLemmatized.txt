economic growth slow pace well experienced earlier year .
Even so , member acknowledge economy displayed remarkable
resiliency past year despite subject severe adverse shock .

spending held relatively well . Business investment expenditure continued
constrain high degree uncertainty related caution . Looking beyond
near term , member anticipate prevail uncertainty begin
diminish , economy-s resiliency abet broadly accommodative monetary
fiscal police continuation strong uptrend productivity would underpin
gradual economic recovery . Indeed , member comment even
robust recovery could rule absence major shock
confidence . pressure labor resource expect limited

Committee-s discussion policy intermeeting period ahead ,
member favor proposal reduce target intend federal fund rate
50 basis point 1-1/4 percent . current stance monetary policy still
accommodative provide important support economic activity ,
member concerned generally disappoint data since previous

point longer-lasting spell subpar economic performance
anticipate earlier . circumstance , relatively aggressive ease action could help

to ensure current soft spot economy would prove temporary
enhance odds robust rebound economic activity next year . reason
cite member sizable ease move related perception
diminish stimulus earlier policy ease action indication overall
financial condition , include bank lending term , become restrictive
year even though nominal federal fund rate target change since late
2001 . member agree monetary policy could little improve
performance economy near term , emphasize 50 basis
point ease likely would feed degree market interest rate ,
favorable implication spending next year .
Members comment potential cost policy ease action later prove
need quite limited little risk move
would foster inflationary pressure likely economic condition next
several quarter . Moreover , policy ease could readily unwound without
significant effect financial market reversal appear warrant
grow pressure resource strengthen economy . contrast , failure
take action need falter economic performance would
increase odds cumulatively weaken economy possibly even attendant
deflation . effort offset development , appear materializing ,
would present difficult policy implementation problem .
member indicate that , light contemplate 50 basis point ease action ,
could support shift Committee-s assessment risk economy
tilt toward economic weakness balance foreseeable future , although
voiced reservation need shift . economy probably would
continue underperform period immediately ahead , absence
unpredictable adverse shock sluggish performance likely balance
subsequent economic strength light policy action . 50 basis point move
would tend pronounce effect usual financial market , least
initially , would largely unexpected would come extend
hiatus implement policy change . view many member , retain
assessment risk tilt toward weakness would raise odds
overreaction financial market , might well misread Committee-s decision
sign member concerned potential great economic
weakness fact case therefore Committee currently saw
likely need ease later . member saw lesser risk
development , partly widespread market expectation even sizable
reduction intend federal fund rate Committee would change
assessment unbalanced risk economy present circumstance . Although
least marginal preference retain current tilt toward weakness ,
member willing accept balance statement light uncertainty
surround prospective market reaction . possible market response
primary factor determine desirability policy action , Committee need
take account gauge potential effect particular policy move .
