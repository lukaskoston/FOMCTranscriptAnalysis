 Committee's discussion current prospective developments, members
 agreed economy strengthened somewhat going "soft

 suggested solid growth ahead, pace could well less brisk
 previously anticipated. Consumer spending appeared rebounded third
 quarter. Business investment also robust, executives, especially
 larger firms, seemed cautious outlook several

 growth, questions remained reasons shortfall expectations

 Committee members interpreted recent data anecdotal information indicating
 growth consumer spending rebounding fr om relatively slow rate

 several possible sources downside risk household spending. particular,
 households might hold back spending attempt increase saving,

 Committee members generally viewed labor market conditions improved

 members noted mismatch demand supply certain types labor.
 particular, unskilled workers said considerable difficulty finding
