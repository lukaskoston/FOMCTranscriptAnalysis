 members anticipated labor markets would remain exceptionally tight,

 Committee's discussion outlook economy, members focused
 considerable attention growth rate economy's supply potential--its

 application technological advances associated surge outlays capital

 ongoing. Data productivity capital accumulation become available
 recent months tended confirm trends, statistical evidence
 reinforced comments many business executives persistent upward
 revisions long-term profit forecasts, yet suggest leveling

 Quickening productivity fundamental factor behind economy's
 remarkable performance recent years. Members noted, however, historical
 episodes involving major changes productivity trends rare past

 softening consumer demand tended concentrated sales motor vehicles

 included diminishing wealth effects several months limited changes equity

 noted consumer confidence remained high level, consumer incomes

 housing sector provided clearest indication response aggregate
