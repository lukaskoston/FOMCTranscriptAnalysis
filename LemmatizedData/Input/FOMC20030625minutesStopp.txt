 With economy thought likely continue operate potential

 believed current low-inflation environment would persist next
 several quarters indeed disinflation could store.
 regard, concern inflation could approaching level would begin
 complicate implementation monetary policy economic weakness
 unexpectedly persisted economy subjected another negative demand
 shock. However, view least members, recent developments
 reduced unwelcome prospect substantial additional disinflation.
 developments included recent uptick core measures consumer prices, drop
 dollar foreign exchange markets, still elevated energy prices--all
 backdrop longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored.
 importantly, however, outlook strengthening expansion, might well
 materialize near future, limit disinflationary trend.
 Committee's discussion policy intermeeting period ahead, one
 members indicated could support proposal reduce target
 federal funds rate ¼ percentage point level 1 percent. significant stepup pace expansion appeared likely prospect, outcome

 incoming information since May meeting, mildly encouraging,
 provide compelling evidence warrant forestalling easing action.
 Members saw virtually prospect proposed easing, though would
 reinforce already accommodative monetary policy, would incur significant risk
 contributing rising inflationary pressures, even strengthening
 economy proved somewhat greater incorporated
 forecasts. Indeed, proposed reduction nominal federal funds rate would
 offset apparent increase real federal funds rate stemming
 recent decline inflation. regard, disinflation seemed likely

 members expressed preference limiting reduction ¼
 percentage point. commented good case could made ½
 percentage point easing, though one members could support
 smaller decrease. Views cited favor ¼ percentage point easing included
 emergence firmer signs possible upturn economic activity, near-term
 prospect substantial added fiscal stimulus, already accommodative
 stance monetary policy. member expressed opinion smaller move
 favored concerns dislocations resulting low
