 discussion economic situation outlook, meeting participants focused
 potential recent credit market developments restrain aggregate demand
 coming quarters. disruptions market nonconforming mortgages
 likely reduce demand housing, recent financial developments
 could well lead general tightening credit availability. Moreover,
 recent data anecdotal information pointed possible nascent slowdown
 pace expansion. Given unusual nature current financial shock,
 participants regarded outlook economic activity characterized
 particularly high uncertainty, risks growth skewed downside.
 participants cited concerns weaker economy could lead tightening
 financial conditions, turn could reinforce economic slowdown.
 participants also noted resilience economy face number
 previous periods financial market disruptions left open possibility
 macroeconomic effects financial market turbulence would prove limited.
 Although financial markets expected stabilize time, participants judged
 credit markets likely restrain economic growth period ahead. Given
 existing commitments customers increased resistance investors
 purchasing securitized products, banks might need take large volume
 assets onto balance sheets coming weeks, including leveraged loans, assetbacked commercial paper, types mortgages. Banks' concerns
 implications rapid growth balance sheets capital ratios
 liquidity, well recent deterioration various term funding markets,
 
 might well lead banks tighten availability credit households firms.
 Tighter credit conditions likely weigh particularly residential investment
 lesser extent components aggregate demand coming quarters.
 Meeting participants also noted financial market conditions, seeming
 improved somewhat recent days, still fragile
 adverse credit market developments could well increase downside risks
 economy. Even market volatility subsided recent strains eased, risk
 spreads probably would wider credit terms tighter
 months ago. Although developments would likely consistent longer-term
 financial stability, likely exert restraint aggregate demand.
 discussion individual sectors economy, participants noted recent
 data suggested greater weakness housing market previously
 expected. Furthermore, recent financial developments potential deepen
 prolong downturn housing market, subprime mortgages
 remained essentially unavailable, little activity evident markets
 nonprime mortgages, prime jumbo mortgage borrowers faced higher rates
 tighter lending standards. faster pace foreclosures subprime mortgage rates
 reset also seen posing downside risk housing market. Nonetheless,
 participants observed conforming mortgages remained readily available
 creditworthy borrowers rates mortgages declined recent
 weeks. Moreover, conditions jumbo mortgage market expected improve
 gradually time.
 Although employment probably weak recent monthly data
 suggested, trend growth jobs fallen even prior recent financial market
 strains, participants judged slowing employment growth
 likely. Indeed, financial services firms already announced layoffs, largely reflecting
 mortgage market developments, demand temporary workers appeared
 softened, recent weakening construction employment likely
 continue while. Moreover, declines house prices damp consumption,
 could feed back employment income, exerting additional restraint
 demand housing. Nonetheless, date, initial claims unemployment insurance
 indicate substantial widespread weakening labor demand, labor
 markets across country generally remained fairly tight, several participants
 citing continued reports shortages labor contacts sectors.
 Participants thought likely prospect consumer expenditures
 continue expand moderate pace average coming quarters, supported
 growth employment income. However, participants saw indications
 possible weakening consumer spending. Sales automobiles building
 materials flagged late, survey measures suggested consumer
 confidence adversely affected recent financial market developments.
 Also, tightening terms home equity lines credit second
 mortgages seemed possible, could weigh consumer spending, especially
 consumer durables.
 Participants reported recent financial market developments generally appeared
 limited effects date business capital spending plans expected
 business investment likely remain healthy coming quarters. access
 
 of investment-grade corporate borrowers credit far remained unimpeded,
 rates investment-grade bonds declined recent weeks. Moreover, participants
 noted many capital expenditures internally financed, making less
 sensitive credit market conditions. Nonetheless, pace financing lowerrated firms--including issuance speculative-grade bonds leveraged loans-had slowed sharply summer. Participants also noted standards

 Participants made modest revisions outlook inflation period
 since Committee's last regular meeting. Still, recognized incoming data
 core inflation continued favorable, generally little
 confident decline inflation earlier year would sustained. Inflation
 expectations seemed contained, less robust economic outlook implied
 somewhat less pressure resources going forward. Participants nonetheless
 remained concerned possible upside risks inflation. Higher benefit costs,

 Committee's discussion policy intermeeting period, members
 favored easing stance monetary policy. Members emphasized
 recent sharp change credit market conditions, incoming data many
 cases limited value assessing likely evolution economic activity

 saw risk tightening credit conditions intensifying housing correction
