 circumstances, Committee judged policy firming may
 needed keep risks attainment sustainable economic growth
 price stability roughly balance, reiterated event Committee
 would respond changes economic prospects needed foster objectives.
 
 Investors anticipated FOMC's decision March meeting raise target
 federal funds rate 25 basis points, Committee's post-meeting statement
 evidently led mark somewhat expected path federal funds
 rate. Subsequently, path pushed data releases were,
 balance, stronger market participants expected. Speeches Federal
 Reserve officials, minutes March meeting, Congressional testimony
 Chairman combined restrain policy expectations some. net, anticipated
 path federal funds rate next two years nonetheless rotated upward.
 Yields inflation-indexed Treasury securities moved intermeeting
 period, yields nominal Treasury issues rose more. Spreads yields
 investment-grade bonds comparable-maturity Treasury securities
 unchanged, speculative-grade bonds declined. Major stock price
 indexes bit intermeeting period, positive first-quarter earnings
 reports offset negative effects higher energy prices rising
 interest rates.
 trade-weighted exchange value dollar major foreign currencies fell
 since March meeting. Increased focus public debate risks posed
 large U.S. external imbalance appeared erode investor support dollar.
 Domestic nonfinancial sector debt estimated grown robust pace
 first quarter, slightly brisk pace 2005. Business sector debt
 appeared expanded strongly, supported significant net issuance U.S.
 corporate bonds double-digit growth business loans commercial banks.
 household sector, consumer credit continued rise slowly, growth

 somewhat first quarter backdrop higher mortgage interest rates
 signs deceleration house prices. M2 advanced pace somewhat
 nominal GDP first quarter estimated expanded
 moderately April.
 staff forecast prepared meeting showed real GDP growth moderating
 somewhat average pace previous several quarters. projected
 deceleration real GDP reflected lagged effects tightening monetary
 policy, waning impetus increases household wealth, reduced stimulus
 fiscal policy. higher energy prices expected boost inflation
 near term, structural productivity strong, influence higher energy
 material costs thought likely moderate. Thus, consumer prices, increasing
 faster rate first half year, expected decelerate later year
 next year.
 discussion economic situation outlook, meeting participants saw
 economy rebounded strongly far year slowing
 growth fourth quarter. advance output vigorous first
 quarter year, real GDP increasing around 5 percent annual rate.
 Although expansion appeared likely moderate, evidently remained solid.
 Inflation pressures appeared somewhat greater Committee
 anticipated time March meeting. Consumer prices recently risen
 pace noticeably average rise previous twelve months. Also, prices
 
 of energy many commodities climbed sharply late, inflation
 expectations appeared risen slightly. economic growth continued
 moderate coming quarters, anticipated, pressures productive resources
 would likely continue limited. participants expected that,
 allowing possible near-term volatility related recent jump energy
 commodity prices, core inflation would probably remain around levels
 experienced average past year. However, recent developments suggested
 upside risks inflation risen somewhat since time March
 meeting.
 discussion major sectors economy, participants noted
 growth household spending likely slow remainder year.
 Anecdotal information pointed cooling housing markets. cooling
 especially noticeable high-end homes houses markets previously
 experienced steepest appreciation. Data home sales, permits, starts
 whole likewise suggested activity gradually diminishing. reports
 indicated speculative building homes dropped considerably,
 inventories unsold homes still seemed expanding. Although fresh
 comprehensive data available, home prices average appeared still
 rising, slower pace past years. Going forward, growth
 consumption spending likely supported gains employment
 personal income. slower appreciation home prices effects
 increases energy prices interest rates already occurred would likely
 act restrain consumption spending somewhat. Certain features recently popular
 nontraditional mortgage products potential cause financial difficulties
 households erode mortgage loan performance lenders.
 Nonetheless, household sector seemed likely remain sound financial
 condition overall. balance, consumption spending viewed likely
 expand moderate pace coming quarters.
 Several participants remarked business investment spending robust.
 Nonresidential construction accelerating notably, process absorbing
 resources diverted housing. Office vacancy rates
 declining, spurring construction new office buildings. Drilling mining activity
 said particularly strong, propelled high levels energy prices.
 Investment equipment software appeared expanding solid rate.
 Capital formation likely continue supported rising output, strong
 balance sheets business sector, ready availability financing attractive
 terms.
 participants commented recent surge federal tax revenues,
 development mirrored state level. precise reasons
 increase federal receipts entirely clear, robust income growth
 probably important factor. case, effect trim current federal
 budget deficit noticeably. Nonetheless, longer-run federal fiscal imbalance
 remained serious concern.
 Data economic growth outside United States indicated global
 expansion firming, sense amplified reports international contacts.
 
 apparent strengthening global growth likely support U.S. exports
 economic activity would also tend maintain upward pressures energy
 commodity prices.
 Meeting participants expressed concern recent price developments
 implications inflation prospects. Core consumer inflation lately
 little higher expected. Moreover, energy prices risen steeply period
 since March meeting, and, although pass-through apparently limited
 date, recent increases might reflected greater degree core inflation
 coming months. Participants noted prices non-energy commodities,
 industrial metals building supplies, also climbing. recent decline
 dollar another factor could add inflation pressures, although effect
 prior changes foreign exchange value dollar core consumer prices
 apparently limited. Business contacts reported continued shortages
 certain types skilled labor related wage pressures occupations,
 would tend boost costs.
 However, participants also cited factors could expected restrain
 inflation. Although alternative measures labor compensation provided divergent
 readings, growth total compensation balance appeared remain moderate.
 And, even nominal wages accelerate somewhat, relatively wide profit
 margins could buffer effect prices final goods services. firms
 would seek maintain margins, recent experience suggested might
 accomplished part productivity gains, remained fairly
 strong balance recent quarters, rather rapid price hikes.
 Participants discussed detail inflation expectations--a potentially important
 factor influencing future inflation trends. surveys suggested inflation
 expectations risen recent weeks, others implied expectations
 little changed. Measures inflation compensation based difference
 yields nominal Treasury securities inflation-indexed issues edged higher.
 possible, though, investors' uncertainty regarding inflation prospects,
 inflation expectations themselves, risen. balance, participants judged
 inflation expectations risen somewhat--a development would
 taken account policymaking warranted close monitoring--but remained
 contained.
 Although Committee discussed policy approaches ranging leaving stance
 policy unchanged meeting increasing federal funds rate 50 basis
 points, members believed additional 25 basis point firming policy
 appropriate today keep inflation rising promote sustainable economic
 expansion. Recent price developments argued another firming step today's
 meeting. Core inflation recently bit higher expected,
 several members remarked core inflation around upper end
 viewed acceptable range. Moreover, number factors augmenting
 upside risks inflation: surge energy commodity prices, recent
 weakness foreign exchange value dollar, possibility
 apparent increase inflation expectations could, persisted, impart momentum
 inflation. addition, economy appeared operating relatively high level
 
 of resource utilization growing quite strongly, whether economic
 growth would moderate sustainable pace yet clear. time,
 members also saw downside risks economic activity. example, cumulative
 effect past monetary policy actions recent rise longer-term interest rates
 housing activity prices could turn larger expected. Still,
 seemed likely that, modest policy action, including 25 basis point
 firming today, growth activity would moderate gradually coming quarters,
 pressures resources would remain limited, core inflation would stay close
 levels experienced past year.
 Given risks growth inflation, Committee members uncertain
 much, any, tightening would needed today's action. view

 However, apparent pickup longer-term expectations, worrisome,
