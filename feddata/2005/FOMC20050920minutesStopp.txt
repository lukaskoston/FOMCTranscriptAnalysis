 that, despite high energy prices, aggregate spending appeared strengthened,

 Committee's discussion monetary policy intermeeting period, nearly
 members favored raising target federal funds rate 25 basis points 3-3/4
 percent meeting. Although uncertainty increased, Committee's
 judgment fundamental factors influencing longer-term path economy
 probably affected hurricane, upside risks inflation

 rate increases probably would required. Moreover, uncertainties
