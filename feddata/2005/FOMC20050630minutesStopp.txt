 Several meeting participants expressed concern domestic global
 imbalances. Large federal budget deficits expected persist despite increase
 tax receipts recent months. deficits contributing low level
 national saving would, corrected time, ultimately constrain
 investment overall economic growth. Moreover, U.S. trade deficits expected
 remain large going forward, reflecting low level U.S. saving

 discussion developments asset markets, participants' comments
 focused two related issues: low level long-term interest rates
 continued run-up home prices. Despite substantial cumulative policy tightening
 past year, long-term Treasury yields moved considerably lower,
 implying significant flattening yield curve (measured spread
 long-term short-term Treasury yields). Lower compensation inflation
 accounted portion decline longer-term nominal yields, larger
 portion reflected reductions real yields. Participants cited variety factors
 possibly contributing unusual behavior long-term rates period.

 necessary contain inflation keep output line potential--perhaps
 reflecting weak investment demand abroad relative saving--or even might

 Participants' views inflation outlook mixed. Thus far 2005, core
 consumer price inflation higher participants expected
 start year, reflecting, least part, pass-through effects higher energy,
 commodity, import prices. shocks could expected boost inflation
 temporarily, participants expressed concern that, policy still
 accommodative, underlying pace inflation might process stepping
 up, perhaps level upper end range viewed
 compatible Committee's price stability objective. degree slack
 remaining labor resource markets uncertain, unit labor costs
 nonfarm business sector moved notably higher recent quarters. Trend unit
 labor costs could also boosted slower growth structural productivity;
 recent evidence conclusive, participants thought underlying pace
 productivity growth might well fall back coming quarters following substantial
 gains seen recent years. higher energy prices already eating profit
 margins firms outside energy sector, increases unit labor costs might
 likely passed prices.
 agreeing inflation developments watched carefully,
 meeting participants emphasized recent core inflation data relatively
 restrained, anecdotal reports suggested pricing power many firms
 remained quite limited. Moreover, readings futures markets suggested oil
 prices would likely flatten out, effect inflation gradually ebb.
 Similarly, prices commodities imports, surged time,
 moderating. Survey market measures long-term inflation expectations
 suggest earlier higher inflation readings going persist. Finally,
 degree slack labor markets uncertain, total labor compensation
 probably boosted temporarily around turn year special factors,
 recent behavior range indicators labor costs appeared
 consistent remaining slack would likely tend restrain inflation
 pressures. Moreover, anecdotal reports labor market conditions continued point
 shortages labor certain, mostly skilled, occupations.

 Economic growth remained firm, rising energy, possibly labor, costs
