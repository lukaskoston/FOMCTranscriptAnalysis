 utilization. Indeed, limited available evidence pointed rebound household
 spending, especially motor vehicles, July early August, indicators
 suggested continued improvement labor market conditions. Regarding outlook

 discussed number factors may contributed slowdown,
 including waning stimulus last year's tax cuts, previously

 may felt need boost saving. Although complete accounting
 moderation growth possible, Committee agreed resumption

 gains income, low interest rates, robust consumer confidence seen
 undergirding gains household spending going forward. Members noted
 reports rising motor vehicle sales July early August firming chain

 spending picking up.

 slowing job growth reported June July. Committee members pointed
 several factors might contributed recent weakness. Firms' focus
 controlling costs implementing productivity improvements
 doubtless continuing play role. Higher labor costs, particularly related

 however, members thought rapid productivity growth flat declining

 higher rates headline inflation earlier year, longer-term inflation
 expectations remained well contained slack resource markets seen
 persisting, leading Committee expect underlying inflation relatively low.
