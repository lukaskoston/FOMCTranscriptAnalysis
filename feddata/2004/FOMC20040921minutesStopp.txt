 Committee's discussion current prospective developments, members
 agreed economy strengthened somewhat going "soft

 suggested solid growth ahead, pace could well less brisk
 previously anticipated. Consumer spending appeared rebounded third
 quarter. Business investment also robust, executives, especially
 larger firms, seemed cautious outlook several
 months ago. Although higher energy prices played important role damping
 growth, questions remained reasons shortfall expectations

 discussion developments key sectors economy, policymakers
 agreed business investment would likely continue provide considerable
 impetus overall economic expansion going forward. anticipated

 Committee members interpreted recent data anecdotal information indicating
 growth consumer spending rebounding fr om relatively slow rate
 late spring. saw household spending likely continuing expand
 solid pace going forward. Gains nominal income, partly resulting gradual
 increases employment, expected continue support consumer spending
 low interest rates buoy residential investment. However, members perceived
 several possible sources downside risk household spending. particular,
 households might hold back spending attempt increase saving,
 fallen low level relative income. ebbing stimulus last
 year's tax cuts also could tend slow growth consumer spending. failure

 Committee members generally viewed labor market conditions improved
 modestly late. Although payroll growth weak June July,
 registered somewhat better performance August, initial claims
 unemployment insurance continued hover around relatively low levels.
 members noted mismatch demand supply certain types labor.
 particular, unskilled workers said considerable difficulty finding
 jobs, firms facing challenges hiring workers specific skills,
 including truck drivers heavy-equipment operators. Partly result, businesses
