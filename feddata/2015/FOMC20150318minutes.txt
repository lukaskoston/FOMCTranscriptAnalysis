Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet
In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets. The deputy manager followed with a review of System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on January 27–28, 2015. The deputy manager
also discussed the outcomes of recent tests of supplementary normalization tools—namely, the Term Deposit Facility (TDF) and term and overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations (term RRP operations
and ON RRP operations, respectively). The TDF operations were executed as three overlapping 21-day term
operations with same-day settlement; the total amount
of term deposits outstanding peaked at roughly the same

level as in the largest operation conducted in prior testing. The term RRP operations were executed as a series
of four one-week operations and conducted away from
quarter-end; take-up primarily represented substitution
away from ON RRP operations. The combination of
these term and ON RRP test operations continued to
provide a soft floor for money market rates over the intermeeting period.
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the
intermeeting period. There were no intervention
operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account
over the intermeeting period.
Normalization Tools
A staff briefing provided background on options for setting the aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility in the
early stages of the normalization process. Two options
were discussed: initially setting a temporarily elevated
aggregate cap or suspending the aggregate cap for a
time. The briefing noted that, as the balance sheet normalizes and reserve balances decline, usage of the ON
RRP facility should diminish, allowing the facility to be
phased out over time. In addition, the briefing outlined
strategies for actively reducing take-up at the ON RRP
facility after policy normalization is under way, while
maintaining an appropriate degree of monetary control,
if take-up is larger than the FOMC desires. These strategies included adjusting the values of the interest on excess reserves (IOER) and ON RRP rates associated with
a given target range for the federal funds rate, relying on
tools such as term RRPs and the TDF to broaden arbitrage opportunities and to drain reserve balances, and
selling shorter-term Treasury securities to reduce the size
of the balance sheet at a faster pace. In addition, the
briefing presented some information on specific calibrations of policy tools that could be used during the early
stages of policy normalization.
In their discussion of the options and strategies surrounding the use of tools at liftoff and the potential subsequent reduction in aggregate ON RRP capacity, participants emphasized that during the early stages of policy normalization, it will be a priority to ensure appropriate control over the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates. Against this backdrop, participants
generally saw some advantages to a temporarily elevated
aggregate cap or a temporary suspension of the cap to
ensure that the facility would have sufficient capacity to
support policy implementation at the time of liftoff, but
they also indicated that they expected that it would be
appropriate to reduce ON RRP capacity fairly soon after

Minutes of the Meeting of March 17–18, 2015

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
the Committee begins firming the stance of policy. A
couple of participants stated their view that the risks to
financial stability that might arise from a temporarily elevated aggregate ON RRP capacity were likely to be
small, and it was noted that there might be little potential
for a temporarily large Federal Reserve presence in
money markets to affect the structure of those markets
if plans for reducing the facility’s capacity were clearly
communicated and well understood. However, a couple
of participants expressed financial stability concerns, and
one stressed that more planning was needed to address
the potential risks before the Committee decides on the
appropriate level of ON RRP capacity at the time of liftoff.
In their discussion regarding strategies for reducing ON
RRP usage, should it become undesirably large during
the early stages of normalization, most participants
viewed raising the IOER rate, thereby widening the
spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates, as an appropriate initial step. A majority of participants thought
term reserve draining tools could be useful in reducing
ON RRP usage, although a couple of participants questioned their effectiveness in placing upward pressure on
market interest rates, and a few did not see term RRPs
as reducing the Federal Reserve’s presence in money
markets, arguing that investors view term and overnight
RRPs as close substitutes. Many participants mentioned
that selling assets that will mature in a relatively short
time could be considered at some stage, if necessary to
reduce ON RRP usage. However, a number of participants noted that it could be difficult to communicate the
reason for such sales to the public, and, in particular, that
the announcement of such sales would risk an outsized
market reaction, as the public could view the sales as a
signal of a tighter overall stance of monetary policy than
they had anticipated or as an indication that the Committee might be more willing than had been thought to
sell longer-term assets. Some participants pointed out
that an earlier end to reinvestments of principal on maturing or prepaying securities would help reduce the level
of reserve balances, thereby increasing the effectiveness
of the IOER rate and allowing a more rapid reduction in
the size of the ON RRP facility. A number of participants suggested that it would be useful to consider specific plans for these and other details of policy normalization under a range of post-liftoff scenarios.

The statement titled Policy Normalization Principles and
Plans is available on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.

Participants also discussed whether to communicate to
the public additional details regarding the approach they
intend to take when it becomes appropriate to begin the
normalization process, including the width of the target
range for the federal funds rate, the settings of the IOER
and ON RRP rates, and the use of supplementary tools.
A couple of participants suggested communicating a
specific commitment to reducing ON RRP capacity
soon after liftoff. However, a number of participants
emphasized that maintaining control of short-term interest rates would be paramount in the initial stages of
policy normalization, and that it was difficult to know in
advance when a reduction would be appropriate. They
therefore desired to retain some flexibility over the timing of any reduction. That said, many participants
agreed that an elevated aggregate capacity for the facility
would likely be appropriate only for a short period after
liftoff.
At the conclusion of their discussion, all participants
agreed to augment the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing the following additional details regarding the operational approach the
FOMC intends to use when it becomes appropriate to
begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy.3
When economic conditions warrant the commencement
of policy firming, the Federal Reserve intends to:





Continue to target a range for the federal funds rate
that is 25 basis points wide.
Set the IOER rate equal to the top of the target
range for the federal funds rate and set the offering
rate associated with an ON RRP facility equal to the
bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate.
Allow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to
be temporarily elevated to support policy implementation; adjust the IOER rate and the parameters of
the ON RRP facility, and use other tools such as
term operations, as necessary for appropriate monetary control, based on policymakers’ assessments
of the efficacy and costs of their tools. The Committee expects that it will be appropriate to reduce
the capacity of the facility fairly soon after it commences policy firming.

A staff briefing outlined some options for further testing
of term RRP operations over future quarter-ends. While
the tests of term RRPs to date had been informative, the
staff suggested that if the Committee envisioned using

Page 4
Federal Open Market Committee
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
term RRPs as part of its strategy at liftoff, or potentially
at some other point during normalization, continued
testing may be useful. Participants discussed whether a
resolution that authorized term RRP test operations at
quarter-ends through the end of 2015 might reduce the
probability that market participants mistakenly interpret
future decisions about testing term RRPs over quarterends as containing information about the likely timing of
liftoff. It was noted that such a resolution would be
more efficient from an administrative and communications standpoint, as it would simply allow a continuation
of recent quarter-end testing of term RRPs. Moreover,
the resolution would not convey any information regarding either the timing of the start of policy normalization
or whether term RRP operations might be employed at
the time of liftoff and, if so, for how long.
Following the discussion of the testing of term RRP
operations, the Committee approved the following
resolution on term RRP testing over quarter-ends
through January 29, 2016:
“During each of the periods of June 18 to 29,
2015; September 18 to 29, 2015; and December
17 to 30, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York to conduct a series of term
reverse repurchase operations involving U.S.
government securities. Such operations shall:
(i) mature no later than July 8, 2015, October 7,
2015, and January 8, 2016, respectively; (ii) be
subject to an overall size limit of $300 billion
outstanding at any one time; (iii) be subject to a
maximum bid rate of five basis points above the
ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of
the operation; (iv) be awarded to all submitters:
(A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of
the bids received is less than or equal to the preannounced size of the operation, or (B) at the
stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in
ascending order by submitted rate up to the
point at which the total quantity of bids equals
the preannounced size of the operation, with all
bids below this rate awarded in full at the stopout rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded
on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counterparty offers received is greater than the preannounced size of the operation. Such operations
may be for forward settlement. The System
Open Market Account manager will inform the
FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned
operations. The Chair must approve the terms
of, timing of the announcement of, and timing

of the operations. These operations shall be
conducted in addition to the authorized overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which remain subject to a separate overall size limit authorized by the FOMC.”
Mr. Lacker dissented in the vote on the resolution because the March end-of-quarter testing had not yet been
completed and he felt that there was no need to authorize additional testing before then.
The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discussion of normalization tools.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the March 17‒18 meeting
suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP)
growth moderated in the first quarter and that labor market conditions improved further. Consumer price inflation was restrained significantly by declines in energy
prices and continued to run below the FOMC’s longerrun objective of 2 percent. Market-based measures of
inflation compensation were still low, while survey
measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained
stable.
Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand
strongly in January and February. The unemployment
rate declined to 5.5 percent in February. Both the labor
force participation rate and the employment-topopulation ratio rose slightly over the first two months
of the year, and the share of workers employed part time
for economic reasons edged down. The rate of privatesector job openings moved up in January and was at an
elevated level; the rate of quits remained the same as in
the fourth quarter, but the rate of hiring stepped down.
Industrial production decreased a little, on net, in January and February, as declines in the output of the manufacturing and mining sectors more than offset an increase in utilities production. Some indicators of mining
activity, such as counts of drilling rigs in operation,
dropped further. However, automakers’ assembly
schedules and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally
pointed to modest gains in factory output in coming
months.
Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to decelerate somewhat going into the first quarter after rising markedly in the fourth quarter. The components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of
PCE declined slightly in January and February, and light

Minutes of the Meeting of March 17–18, 2015

motor vehicle sales stepped down; unusually severe
weather in some regions in February may have accounted for a small part of the slowing in consumer
spending in that month. Recent information about key
factors that influence household spending pointed toward a pickup in PCE in the coming months. The purchasing power of households’ income continued to be
supported by low energy prices, and real disposable income rose briskly in January. Moreover, households’ net
worth likely increased as equity prices and home values
advanced further, and consumer sentiment in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers was still near
its highest level since prior to the most recent recession.
The pace of activity in the housing sector remained slow.
Both starts and building permits for new single-family
homes declined over January and February. Starts of
multifamily units also decreased, on net, over the past
two months. Sales of new and existing homes moved
down in January, although pending home sales increased
somewhat.
Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be expanding in
the first quarter at about the same modest pace as in the
previous quarter. Both nominal orders and shipments
of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in
January. New orders for these capital goods remained
above the level of shipments, indicating that shipments
may increase in subsequent months. Other forwardlooking indicators, such as national and regional surveys
of business conditions, were generally consistent with
modest increases in business equipment spending in the
near term. Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential
structures moved down in January after rising in the
fourth quarter.
Federal spending data for January and February pointed
toward a further decline in real federal government purchases in the first quarter. Real state and local government purchases appeared to be rising modestly in the
first quarter as their payrolls increased in recent months,
although their construction expenditures decreased a little in January.
The U.S. international trade deficit widened substantially
in December before narrowing somewhat in January.
Exports declined in both December and January, reflecting weak agricultural goods exports, the lower price of
petroleum products, and falling or flat exports of most
other categories of goods. Imports rose in December,
with an increased volume of petroleum imports, but declined in January, driven by lower prices and volumes for
petroleum.

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE
price index, edged up only ¼ percent over the
12 months ending in January, as energy prices declined
significantly. The core PCE price index, which excludes
food and energy prices, rose 1¼ percent over the same
12-month period. Measures of expected long-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan
survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the Survey of
Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable. Market-based measures
of inflation compensation were still low. Measures of
labor compensation continued to increase at a modest
pace, although faster than consumer prices. Both compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector and
the employment cost index rose 2¼ percent over the
year ending in the fourth quarter. Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2 percent over the
12 months ending in February.
Foreign real GDP appeared to expand at a moderate
pace in the fourth quarter. While GDP growth stepped
down in several economies, including Canada and China,
it picked up in the euro area, Japan, and Mexico. Indicators for the first quarter suggested continued firming
in the euro area and further slowing in China and Canada. Consumer prices in many foreign economies declined further in the first months of this year, reflecting
the falls in energy prices as well as decreases in food
prices in some emerging market economies. Many central banks took steps to ease monetary policy during the
period, including the European Central Bank (ECB),
which began purchasing sovereign bonds under its public sector purchase program (PSPP), and the People’s
Bank of China, which lowered required reserve ratios for
banks. A number of other central banks in advanced
and emerging market economies cut policy interest rates.
Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Movements in asset prices over the intermeeting period
largely seemed to reflect receding concerns about downside risks to the global economic outlook. Two strong
U.S. employment reports and the January consumer
price index release, all of which were above market expectations; the start of sovereign bond purchases by the
ECB; and the somewhat more encouraging economic
news from Europe all appeared to contribute to the improved sentiment in financial markets. Equity prices
were higher, on net, although they declined later in the
period.
Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting
period, including the minutes of the January FOMC

Page 6

meeting, reportedly were perceived as slightly more accommodative than expected on balance. Market commentary also highlighted Chair Yellen’s statement at the
Monetary Policy Report testimony that the eventual removal
of the language in the policy statement noting that “the
Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to
normalize the stance of monetary policy” should not be
viewed as indicating that the federal funds rate would
necessarily be increased within a couple of meetings.
However, the effects of these communications on the
expected path for the federal funds rate were more than
offset by reactions to stronger-than-expected data for
the labor market and consumer inflation, along with perceptions of receding downside risks to the foreign economic outlook. On net, the expected path for the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes shifted
up over the period.
Yields on nominal Treasury securities increased across
the maturity spectrum, and the Treasury yield curve
steepened. Measures of inflation compensation based
on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities increased
early in the intermeeting period amid rising oil prices but
ended the period little changed, on net, after oil prices
dropped back.
Broad U.S. equity price indexes moved up, on balance,
over the intermeeting period, and one-month optionimplied volatility on the S&P 500 index moved down on
net. Spreads of 10-year corporate bond yields over those
on comparable-maturity Treasury securities for both
BBB-rated and speculative-grade issuers narrowed notably, likely reflecting increased appetite for riskier investments. While the tightening of spreads was broad based,
the declines in short- and intermediate-term spreads for
speculative-grade energy firms were particularly pronounced, retracing most of their strong run-up approaching the end of last year.
Results from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and
Survey of Market Participants for March indicated that
the respondents attached the greatest probabilities to the
first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate
occurring at either the June or September FOMC meeting; those probabilities were marked up relative to the
January survey. In addition, survey respondents widely
expected the “patient” language to be removed from the
FOMC statement following the March meeting. Conditional on this change in the statement, respondents assigned a roughly 40 percent probability, on average, to
liftoff occurring two meetings ahead and assigned most
of the remaining probability to later dates.

Credit conditions faced by large nonfinancial firms remained generally accommodative. Corporate bond issuance increased in February, mostly reflecting activity by
investment-grade firms. Commercial and industrial
loans on banks’ books continued to expand strongly, reportedly in part to fund increased merger and acquisition
activity. Institutional leveraged loan issuance during January and February was supported by strong issuance of
new money loans, while refinancing activity effectively
came to a stop, likely reflecting elevated loan spreads.
On net, issuance of collateralized loan obligations was
only modestly below the strong pace registered in the
fourth quarter of 2014.
Financing for the commercial real estate (CRE) sector
stayed broadly available over the intermeeting period.
Growth of CRE loans on banks’ books remained solid,
in part supported by loans to finance construction activity. The issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was still robust so far this year, and
spreads continued to be low. After taking into account
deals in the pipeline for March, issuance in the first quarter of 2015 was expected to be the strongest since the
financial crisis. According to the March Senior Credit
Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms,
dealers’ willingness to provide warehouse financing for
loans intended for inclusion in CMBS increased since
the beginning of 2014. In addition, demand for funding
of CMBS by hedge funds and real estate investment
trusts reportedly rose over the same period.
Credit conditions for mortgages remained tight for riskier borrowers, with relatively few mortgages originated
to borrowers in the lower portion of the credit score distribution. For borrowers who qualify for a mortgage,
the cost of credit stayed low by historical standards.
Consumer credit rose further over the intermeeting period. Auto and student loan balances continued to expand robustly through January, while credit card balances decelerated slightly. Issuance of consumer assetbacked securities remained robust.
The dollar appreciated against most other currencies
over the intermeeting period, as policymakers in the euro
area, Sweden, Denmark, and many emerging market
economies eased monetary policy even as market participants anticipated monetary policy tightening in the
United States. Central bank policymakers in Sweden and
Denmark lowered the rates on their respective deposit
facilities further below zero. In addition, in Sweden, the
benchmark repurchase agreement (or repo) rate was reduced in February to below zero for the first time, and a
further cut was announced in March. Equity prices rose

in most of the advanced foreign economies, with euroarea stocks rallying both before and after the early March
commencement of sovereign bond purchases by the
ECB under its PSPP. Stock market performance in the
emerging market economies was more varied, with net
losses in some and net gains in others. Yields on German government securities declined, with negative yields
extending to longer maturities than at the time of the
January meeting, likely in reaction to the PSPP, and yield
spreads of most other euro-area sovereign bonds over
German bonds narrowed. The main exception was
Greek bonds, spreads on which widened, on net, amid
heightened volatility as negotiations between Greece and
its official creditors over support for the country’s public
finances continued. Yields on the long-term sovereign
bonds of many other countries, including Japan and the
United Kingdom, rose during the period.
Staff Economic Outlook
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for
the March FOMC meeting, projected real GDP growth
in the first half of this year was lower than in the forecast
prepared for the January meeting, largely reflecting
downward revisions to the near-term forecasts for
household spending, net exports, and residential investment. The staff’s medium-term forecast for real GDP
growth also was revised down, mostly because of the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange
value of the dollar. Nonetheless, the staff continued to
forecast that real GDP would expand at a faster pace
than potential output in 2015 and 2016, supported by
increases in consumer and business confidence and a
small pickup in foreign economic growth, even as the
normalization of monetary policy was assumed to begin.
In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to slow toward,
but to remain above, the rate of potential output growth.
The expansion in economic activity over the medium
term was anticipated to gradually reduce resource slack;
the unemployment rate was expected to decline slowly
and to temporarily move a little below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate. In its medium-term
and longer-run projections, the staff slightly lowered its
assumptions for potential GDP growth and real equilibrium interest rates.
The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was little changed, with the large declines in energy prices since
last June still anticipated to lead to a temporary decrease

not participate in this FOMC meeting, and the incoming
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is
scheduled to assume office on July 1. Helen E. Holcomb

in the 12-month change in total PCE prices in the first
half of this year. The staff’s forecast for inflation in 2016
and 2017 was unchanged, as energy prices and non-oil
import prices were still expected to bottom out and
begin rising later this year; inflation was projected to
move closer to, but remain below, the Committee’s
longer-run objective of 2 percent over those years. Inflation was anticipated to move back to 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee’s objective
and slack in labor and product markets projected to have
waned.
The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its
March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the
past 20 years. The risks to the forecasts for real GDP
growth and inflation were viewed as tilted a little to the
downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that neither
monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to
help the economy withstand adverse shocks. At the
same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook
for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the
Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of
the Board of Governors and participating Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the
most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for
each year from 2015 through 2017 and over the longer
run, conditional on each participant’s judgment of appropriate monetary policy.4 The longer-run projections
represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to
which each variable would be expected to converge, over
time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These economic projections and policy assessments are described
in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes.
In their discussion of the economic situation and the
outlook, meeting participants regarded the information
received over the intermeeting period as indicating that
the pace of economic activity had moderated somewhat.
Labor market conditions continued to improve, with
strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate, and

and Blake Prichard, First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Philadelphia, respectively, submitted economic projections.

participants judged that underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish. A number of participants noted that slow growth of productivity or the
labor force could reconcile the moderation in economic
growth with the solid performance of some labor market
indicators. Participants expected that, over the medium
term, real economic activity would expand at a moderate
pace and there would be additional improvements in labor market conditions. Participants generally regarded
the net effect of declines in energy prices as likely to be
positive for economic activity and employment in the
United States, although a couple noted that physical limits on the accumulation of stocks of crude oil could result in further downward pressure on prices and reduce
U.S. oil and gas production and investment. Inflation
had declined further below the Committee’s longer-run
objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and
was expected to stay near its recent low level in the near
term. Market-based measures of inflation compensation
5 to 10 years ahead remained low, while survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable. Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee’s
2 percent objective as the labor market improved further
and the transitory effects of energy price declines and
other factors dissipated. While almost all participants
noted potential risks to the economic outlook resulting
from foreign economic and financial developments,
most saw the risks to the outlook for economic growth
and the labor market as nearly balanced.
Household spending appeared to have slowed somewhat over the intermeeting period, with some participants suggesting that the recent softness in spending indicators was likely due in part to transitory factors, such
as unseasonably cold winter weather in parts of the
country. Some participants expressed the view that
growth in consumer spending over the medium term
would be supported by the strong labor market and rising income, increases in wealth and improvements in
household balance sheets, lower gasoline prices, and
gains in consumer confidence. Although activity in the
housing sector remained sluggish, a few participants
were cautiously optimistic that recent higher rates of
household formation, together with low mortgage rates,
would enable a faster pace of recovery.
Business contacts in many parts of the country continued to express optimism about prospects for future sales
or investment. However, there were widespread reports
of a slowdown in growth during the first quarter across
a range of industries, partly reflecting severe winter
weather in some regions as well as labor disputes at West

Coast ports that temporarily disrupted some supply
chains. In several parts of the country, persistently low
oil prices had resulted in declines in drilling and delays
in planned capital expenditures in the energy sector, and
had negatively affected state government revenues.
Manufacturing contacts in a couple of regions reported
a softening in export sales. In contrast, service-sector
activity had been reasonably strong in several parts of
the country, as had auto sales, and the increase in household purchasing power from lower gasoline prices was
expected to boost retail sales. Labor market conditions
continued to improve in most regions, with wage pressures generally reported to be modest.
In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, several participants noted that the dollar’s further appreciation over the intermeeting period was likely to restrain
U.S. net exports and economic growth for a time. A few
participants suggested that accommodative policy actions by a number of foreign central banks could lead to
a further appreciation of the dollar, but another noted
that such actions had also strengthened the outlook for
growth abroad, which would bolster U.S. exports. Participants pointed to a number of risks to the international economic outlook, including the slowdown in
growth in China, fiscal and financial problems in Greece,
and geopolitical tensions.
Participants saw broad-based improvement in labor
market conditions over the intermeeting period, including strong gains in payroll employment and a further reduction in the unemployment rate. Several participants
judged, based on the improvement in a variety of labor
market indicators, that the economy was making further
progress toward the Committee’s goal of maximum employment. Nonetheless, many judged that some degree
of labor market slack remained, as evidenced by the low
rate of labor force participation, still-elevated involuntary part-time employment, or subdued growth in wages.
A few of them noted that continued modest wage
growth could prompt them to reduce their estimates of
the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. A few
participants observed that the absence of a notable
pickup in wages might not be a useful yardstick for evaluating the degree of remaining slack because of the long
lags between declines in unemployment and the response of wages or uncertainty about trend productivity
growth. One participant, however, saw some evidence
of rising wage growth and suggested that compositional
changes in the labor force could be masking underlying
wage pressures, particularly as measured by average
hourly earnings.

Minutes of the Meeting of March 17–18, 2015

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Many participants judged that the inflation data received
over the intermeeting period had been about in line with
their expectations that inflation would move temporarily
further below the Committee’s goal, largely reflecting
declines in energy prices and lower prices of non-oil imports. They continued to expect that inflation would
move up toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective
over the medium term as the effects of these transitory
factors waned and conditions in the labor market improved further. Survey-based measures of inflation expectations had remained stable, and market-based
measures of inflation compensation over the longer
term were about unchanged from the time of the January
meeting, although they had exhibited some volatility
over the intermeeting period. It was noted that the
market-based measures had tracked quite closely the
movements in crude oil prices over the period, first rising and then falling back. Participants offered various
explanations for this correlation, including that marketbased measures of inflation compensation were responding to the same global developments as oil prices,
that these measures were capturing changes in risk or liquidity premiums, or that inflation-indexed securities
were subject to mispricing. A couple of participants
pointed out that the movements in crude oil prices and
market-based inflation compensation measures had not
been particularly well aligned over a longer historical period, or that information gleaned from inflation derivatives suggested a substantial increase in the probability
that inflation would remain well below the Committee’s
target over the next decade. One of them judged that
the low level of inflation compensation could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse
outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by
weak economic activity, and that it was important not to
dismiss this possible interpretation.
In their discussion of communications regarding the
path of the federal funds rate over the medium term, almost all participants favored removing from the forward
guidance in the Committee’s postmeeting statement the
indication that the Committee would be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.
These participants continued to think that an increase in
the target range for the federal funds rate was unlikely in
April. But, with continued improvement in economic
conditions, they preferred language that would provide
the Committee with the flexibility to subsequently adjust
the target range for the federal funds rate on a meetingby-meeting basis. It was noted that eliminating the reference to being patient would be appropriate in light of

the considerable progress achieved toward the Committee’s objective of maximum employment, and that such
a change would not indicate that the Committee had decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target
range for the federal funds rate. Participants generally
judged that the appropriate timing of liftoff would depend on their assessment of improvement in the labor
market and their degree of confidence that inflation
would move back to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term, and that it would be helpful
to convey to the public this data-dependent approach to
monetary policy. A few participants emphasized that the
decision regarding the appropriate timing of liftoff
should take account of the risks that could be associated
with departing from the effective lower bound later and
those that could be associated with departing earlier.
One participant did not favor the change to the forward
guidance because, with inflation well below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run target, the announcement of a
meeting-by-meeting approach to policy could lead to a
tightening of financial conditions that would slow progress toward the Committee’s objectives.
Participants expressed a range of views about how they
would assess the outlook for inflation and when they
might deem it appropriate to begin removing policy accommodation. It was noted that there were no simple
criteria for such a judgment, and, in particular, that, in a
context of progress toward maximum employment and
reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2
percent over the medium term, the normalization process could be initiated prior to seeing increases in core
price inflation or wage inflation. Further improvement
in the labor market, a stabilization of energy prices, and
a leveling out of the foreign exchange value of the dollar
were all seen as helpful in establishing confidence that
inflation would turn up. Several participants judged that
the economic data and outlook were likely to warrant
beginning normalization at the June meeting. However,
others anticipated that the effects of energy price declines and the dollar’s appreciation would continue to
weigh on inflation in the near term, suggesting that conditions likely would not be appropriate to begin raising
rates until later in the year, and a couple of participants
suggested that the economic outlook likely would not
call for liftoff until 2016. With regard to communications about the timing of the first increase in the target
range for the federal funds rate, two participants thought
that the Committee should seek to signal its policy intentions at the meeting before liftoff appeared likely, but
two others judged that doing so would be inconsistent

Page 10

with a meeting-by-meeting approach. Finally, many participants commented that it would be desirable to provide additional information to the public about the
Committee’s strategy for policy after the beginning of
normalization. Some participants emphasized that the
stance of policy would remain highly accommodative
even after the first increase in the target range for the
federal funds rate, and several noted that they expected
economic developments would call for a fairly gradual
pace of normalization or that a data-dependent approach would not necessarily dictate increases in the target range at every meeting.
Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period
ahead, members judged that information received since
the FOMC met in January indicated that economic
growth had moderated somewhat. Labor market conditions had improved further, with strong job gains and a
lower unemployment rate; a variety of labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources continued to diminish. Household spending
was rising moderately, with declines in energy prices
boosting household purchasing power. Business fixed
investment was advancing, although the recovery in the
housing sector remained slow and export growth had
weakened. Inflation had declined further below the
Committee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting the
declines in energy prices. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based
measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been
stable. The Committee expected that, with appropriate
monetary policy accommodation, economic activity
would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The
Committee also expected that inflation would remain
near its recent low level in the near term but rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor
market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate. In light
of the uncertainties attending the outlook for inflation,
the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor
inflation developments closely.
In their discussion of language for the postmeeting statement, the Committee agreed that the data received over
the intermeeting period suggested that economic growth
had moderated somewhat. One factor behind that moderation was a slowdown in the growth of exports, and
members decided that the statement should explicitly
note that factor. In addition, data received over the intermeeting period indicated that inflation had declined,

as the Committee had anticipated, and members agreed
to update the statement to reflect their judgment that inflation was likely to remain near its recent low level in
the near term. Members also judged that it was appropriate to note that market-based measures of inflation
compensation remained near levels registered at the time
of the January FOMC meeting.
The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for
the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm
in the statement that the Committee’s decision about
how long to maintain the current target range for the
federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Members
continued to judge that this assessment of progress
would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and
readings on financial and international developments. In
light of the considerable progress to date toward the
Committee’s maximum-employment objective and the
implications of that progress for the outlook for inflation, members agreed to remove from the forward guidance in the postmeeting statement the indication that the
Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to
normalize the stance of monetary policy and to indicate
instead that the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds
rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor
market and is reasonably confident that inflation will
move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium
term. Members viewed the new guidance as consistent
with the outlook for policy that the Committee had expressed in January, and they agreed that the postmeeting
statement should note that an increase in the target range
for the federal funds rate remained unlikely at the April
FOMC meeting; in addition, they generally saw the new
language as providing the Committee with the flexibility
to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate
in June or at a subsequent meeting. Members noted that
the timing of the first increase would depend on the evolution of economic conditions and the outlook, and that
the change in the forward guidance was not intended to
indicate that the Committee had decided on the timing
of the initial increase in the target range for the federal
funds rate.
The Committee also decided to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and
agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgagebacked securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury

Minutes of the Meeting of March 17–18, 2015

securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The Committee agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near
mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may,
for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds
rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the
longer run.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with
the following domestic policy directive:
“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the
Federal Open Market Committee seeks
monetary and financial conditions that will foster
maximum employment and price stability. In
particular, the Committee seeks conditions in
reserve markets consistent with federal funds
trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent. The
Committee directs the Desk to undertake open
market operations as necessary to maintain such
conditions. The Committee directs the Desk to
maintain its policy of rolling over maturing
Treasury securities into new issues and its policy
of reinvesting principal payments on all agency
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in
agency mortgage-backed securities.
The
Committee also directs the Desk to engage in
dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities
transactions. The System Open Market Account
manager and the secretary will keep the
Committee informed of ongoing developments
regarding the System’s balance sheet that could
affect the attainment over time of the
Committee’s
objectives
of
maximum
employment and price stability.”
The vote encompassed approval of the statement below
to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
“Information received since the Federal Open
Market Committee met in January suggests that
economic growth has moderated somewhat.
Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate. A range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish. Household

spending is rising moderately; declines in energy
prices have boosted household purchasing
power. Business fixed investment is advancing,
while the recovery in the housing sector remains
slow and export growth has weakened. Inflation has declined further below the Committee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices. Market-based measures
of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment
and price stability. The Committee expects that,
with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace,
with labor market indicators continuing to
move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee
continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly
balanced. Inflation is anticipated to remain near
its recent low level in the near term, but the
Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory
effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate. The Committee continues to
monitor inflation developments closely.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current
0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds
rate remains appropriate. In determining how
long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market
conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and
inflation expectations, and readings on financial
and international developments. Consistent
with its previous statement, the Committee
judges that an increase in the target range for the
federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April
FOMC meeting. The Committee anticipates
that it will be appropriate to raise the target
range for the federal funds rate when it has seen
further improvement in the labor market and is
reasonably confident that inflation will move

Page 12

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
back to its 2 percent objective over the medium
term. This change in the forward guidance does
not indicate that the Committee has decided on
the timing of the initial increase in the target
range.
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy
of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury
securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the
Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities
at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run
goals of maximum employment and inflation of
2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates
that, even after employment and inflation are
near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the
target federal funds rate below levels the
Committee views as normal in the longer run.”

Voting for this action: Janet L. Yellen, William C. Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley Fischer, Jeffrey M. Lacker, Dennis P. Lockhart, Jerome H. Powell,
Daniel K. Tarullo, and John C. Williams.
Voting against this action: None.
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 28–29,
2015. The meeting adjourned at 10:45 a.m. on March
18, 2015.

Summary of Economic Projections
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on March 17–18, 2015, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each
year from 2015 to 2017 and over the longer run.1 Each
participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her assessment
of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about
the factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The
longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be
expected to converge, over time, under appropriate
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to
the economy. “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined
as the future path of policy that each participant deems
most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and
inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum
employment and stable prices.
________________
1 The

president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas did not
participate in this FOMC meeting, and the incoming president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is scheduled to
assume office on July 1. Helen E. Holcomb and Blake Prichard, First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Philadelphia, respectively, submitted economic projections.

All FOMC participants but one expected that economic
growth under appropriate policy would be somewhat
faster in 2015 and in 2016 than their individual estimates
of the U.S. economy’s longer-run normal growth rate
and at or near its longer-run rate in 2017 (table 1 and
figure 1). Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would continue to decline in 2015 and
2016, and all participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or below their individual judgments of its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017.
Participants saw inflation, as measured by the fourquarter change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), slowing this year but picking
up notably next year; almost all of the participants projected that inflation would be at or close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective in 2017.
As shown in figure 2, all but two participants anticipated
that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target
range for the federal funds rate in 2015. Most expected
that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal
funds rate fairly gradually over the projection period as
labor market conditions and inflation move toward values the Committee judges consistent with the attainment
of its mandated objectives of maximum employment
and stable prices. Most participants continued to expect
that it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to
stay appreciably below its longer-run level after inflation
and unemployment are near mandate-consistent levels,

NOTE: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal
consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy
and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee
on December 16–17, 2014.
1. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
2. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
3. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.
* The lower end of the central tendency for longer-run unemployment from the December projections was corrected on April 8, 2015. The error only affected
the PDF version of the March Summary of Economic Projections.

reflecting the effects of remaining headwinds holding
back the recovery, along with other factors.
Most participants viewed the uncertainty associated with
their outlooks for economic growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the
past 20 years. Most participants also judged the level of
uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the
average level of the past 20 years, although several participants viewed it as higher. In addition, most participants continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly
balanced, though some viewed the risks to economic
growth as weighted to the downside. Equal numbers of
participants saw the risks to inflation as balanced or as
weighted to the downside, while one judged these risks
as tilted to the upside.
The Outlook for Economic Activity
Participants generally projected that, conditional on their
individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow in
2015 and 2016 at a pace somewhat faster than their estimates of its longer-run normal rate and at or near its
longer-run rate in 2017. Participants pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to
solid real output growth over the next few years, including improving labor market conditions, strengthened
household and business balance sheets, the boost to
consumer spending from low energy prices, diminishing
restraint from fiscal policy, and still-accommodative
monetary policy.
Compared with their Summary of Economic Projections
(SEP) contributions in December, all but a couple of
participants revised down their projections of real GDP
growth over the forecast period. A number of participants cited the further appreciation of the dollar and recent weakness in spending and production data as reasons for their revision. The central tendencies of participants’ current projections for real GDP growth were
2.3 to 2.7 percent in 2015 and in 2016, and 2.0 to
2.4 percent in 2017. The central tendency of the projections of real GDP growth over the longer run was 2.0 to
2.3 percent, unchanged from December.
Most participants projected that the unemployment rate
would continue to decline through 2016, and all projected that by the fourth quarter of 2017 the unemployment rate would be at or below their individual judgments of its longer-run normal level. The central
tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 5.0 to
5.2 percent in 2015, 4.9 to 5.1 percent in 2016, and

4.8 to 5.1 percent in 2017. Compared with the December SEP, participants’ projected paths for the unemployment rate generally shifted down slightly through 2017.
Many participants noted that recent data pointing to
faster-than-expected improvement in labor market conditions were an important factor underlying the downward revisions to their unemployment rate forecasts.
More than half of the participants revised down their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment;
as a result, the central tendency of these estimates shifted
down to 5.0 to 5.2 percent. Several participants noted
that still-subdued wage and price inflation despite the
stronger-than-expected momentum in the labor market
suggested a lower level of the longer-run normal unemployment rate than they had thought previously, and a
couple mentioned research indicating that demographic
groups with lower average unemployment rates have
accounted for an increasing fraction of the labor force.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of participants’ views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP
growth and the unemployment rate through 2017. Some
of the diversity of views reflected participants’ individual
assessments of the effects of lower oil prices on consumer spending and business investment, of the extent
to which dollar appreciation would affect real activity, of
the rate at which the forces that have been restraining
the pace of the economic recovery would continue to
abate, of the trajectory for growth in consumption as
labor market slack diminishes, and of the appropriate
path of monetary policy. Relative to the December SEP,
the dispersion of participants’ projections for real GDP
growth was a bit narrower from 2015 through 2017,
while for the unemployment rate, the dispersion was
roughly unchanged.
The Outlook for Inflation
Compared with the December SEP, all participants
marked down their projections for PCE inflation this
year, noting that inflation had been running below their
earlier projections and that significant declines in energy
prices and import prices were putting temporary downward pressure on inflation. All participants saw PCE inflation picking up in 2016, and almost all saw inflation at
or close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective in 2017. All of the participants also marked down
their projections for core PCE inflation this year, and
nearly half revised down their projections for core PCE
inflation in 2016 by 0.2 percentage point or more, with
many noting that core inflation had run below their earlier projections in recent months and several citing declines in non-oil import prices and pass-through of de-

clines in energy prices. Almost all expected core inflation to rise gradually over the projection period and to
reach a level at or near 2 percent in 2017. The central
tendencies for PCE inflation were 0.6 to 0.8 percent in
2015, 1.7 to 1.9 percent in 2016, and 1.9 to 2.0 percent
in 2017, and the central tendencies for core PCE inflation were 1.3 to 1.4 percent in 2015, 1.5 to 1.9 percent
in 2016, and 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017. Factors cited by
participants as likely to contribute to a rise of inflation
toward 2 percent included stable longer-term inflation
expectations, steadily diminishing resource slack, a
pickup in wage growth, the waning effects of declines in
energy prices, and still-accommodative monetary policy.
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation. The range of participants’ projections for PCE inflation in 2015 narrowed somewhat compared with December. The range for PCE inflation in 2016 widened
slightly, likely reflecting in part differences in participants’ assessments of the effects of the declines in energy and import prices on the outlook for inflation. Similarly, the ranges for core PCE inflation narrowed in
2015 and widened slightly in 2016. The range for both
measures in 2017 was relatively little changed and continued to show a very substantial concentration near the
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective by that time.
Appropriate Monetary Policy
Participants judged that it would be appropriate to raise
the target range for the federal funds rate over the projection period as labor market conditions and inflation
move toward values the Committee judges consistent
with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. As shown in figure 2, all but two participants anticipated that it would
be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the
federal funds rate during 2015. However, a large majority projected that the appropriate level of the federal
funds rate would remain below their individual estimates
of its longer-run normal level through 2017.
Most participants projected that the unemployment rate
would be at or somewhat above their estimates of its
longer-run normal level at the end of the year in which
they judged the initial increase in the target range for the
federal funds rate would be warranted. Almost all participants projected that inflation would be below the
Committee’s 2 percent objective that year, but they also
saw inflation rising substantially closer to 2 percent in
the following year.
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target

federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from
2015 to 2017 and over the longer run. The median values of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015, 2016,
and 2017 decreased 50, 62, and 50 basis points, respectively, relative to December, to 0.63, 1.88, and 3.13 percent, while the mean values for those years declined
35, 52, and 32 basis points, respectively, to 0.78, 2.03,
and 3.19 percent. Compared with December, the dispersion of the projections for the appropriate level of
the federal funds rate was a bit narrower over the projection period.
Most participants judged that it would be appropriate for
the federal funds rate in 2017 to remain below its longerrun normal level, with nearly half of them projecting the
federal funds rate in 2017 to be more than ½ percentage
point lower than their estimates of its longer-run value.
Participants provided a number of reasons why they
thought it would be appropriate for the federal funds
rate to remain below its longer-run normal level for
some time after inflation and the unemployment rate
were near mandate-consistent levels. These reasons included an assessment that the headwinds that have been
holding back the recovery will continue to exert some
restraint on economic activity at that time, that weak real
activity abroad and the recent appreciation of the dollar
are likely to continue to restrain U.S. net exports for
some time, that residual slack in the labor market will
still be evident in measures of labor utilization other than
the unemployment rate, and that the risks to the economic outlook are asymmetric as a result of the constraints on monetary policy associated with the effective
lower bound on the federal funds rate.
Relative to the December SEP, almost half of the participants revised down their estimates of the longer-run
level of the federal funds rate, typically by ¼ percentage
point, with a lower assessment of the economy’s longerrun potential growth rate generally cited as a contributing factor for those revisions. Though the median estimate of the longer-run normal federal funds rate was
unchanged from December, the central tendency narrowed to 3.5 to 3.75 percent from 3.5 to 4.0 percent in
December, and the range moved down a bit to 3.0 to
4.25 percent from 3.25 to 4.25 percent in December. All
participants judged that inflation in the longer run would
be equal to the Committee’s inflation objective of 2 percent, implying that their individual judgments regarding
the appropriate longer-run level of the real federal funds
rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy
ranged from 1.0 to 2.25 percent.

Participants’ views of the appropriate path for monetary
policy were informed by their judgments about the state
of the economy, including the values of the unemployment rate and other labor market indicators that would
be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to
which the economy was currently falling short of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation to return
to the Committee’s longer-term objective of 2 percent,
the implications of international developments for the
domestic economy, the desire to minimize potential disruptions in financial markets, and the balance of risks
around the outlook. Some participants also mentioned

Uncertainty and Risks
Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of
uncertainty attending their projections for real GDP
growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to
the norms during the previous 20 years (figure 4).2 Most
participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks
for real GDP growth as broadly balanced, though some
participants viewed the risks to real GDP growth as
weighted to the downside. Those participants who
viewed the risks as weighted to the downside cited, for
example, concern about the limited ability of monetary
policy at the effective lower bound to respond to further
negative shocks to the economy or about the trajectory
for economic growth abroad. Nearly all participants
again judged the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced.
As in the December SEP, participants generally agreed
that the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation forecasts were broadly similar to historical norms.
Almost half of participants viewed the risks to their inflation forecast as balanced. However, the risks were
seen as tilted to the downside by an equal number of
participants, an increase since the December SEP.
These participants cited the possibility that the recent
low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than
anticipated or that the upward pressure on prices from
inflation expectations might be weaker than assumed, or
the judgment that, in current circumstances, it would be
difficult for the Committee to respond effectively to
low-inflation outcomes. Conversely, one participant saw
upside risks to inflation, citing uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Committee’s withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation.

discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projections.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Forecast Uncertainty
The economic projections provided by
the members of the Board of Governors and
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks
inform discussions of monetary policy among
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections,
however. The economic and statistical models
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future
path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events.
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy,
participants consider not only what appears to
be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of
their occurring, and the potential costs to the
economy should they occur.
Table 2 summarizes the average historical
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the
Federal Open Market Committee. The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example,
suppose a participant projects that real gross
domestic product (GDP) and total consumer
prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the
uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks
around the projections are broadly balanced,
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a
probability of about 70 percent that actual
GDP would expand within a range of 1.4 to

4.6 percent in the current year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent
in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent
confidence intervals for overall inflation would
be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year and 1.0
to 3.0 percent in the second and third years.
Because current conditions may differ
from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to
whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each variable is greater than, smaller
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of
forecast uncertainty in the past, as shown in
table 2. Participants also provide judgments as
to whether the risks to their projections are
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the
downside, or are broadly balanced. That is,
participants judge whether each variable is
more likely to be above or below their projections of the most likely outcome. These judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attending each participant’s projections are distinct from the diversity of participants’ views
about the most likely outcomes. Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks associated
with a particular projection rather than with
divergences across a number of different projections.
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds
rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This
uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of
monetary policy depends importantly on the
evolution of real activity and inflation over
time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate
would change from that point forward.
