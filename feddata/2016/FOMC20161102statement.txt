Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has
picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year. Although the unemployment
rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid. Household spending has been
rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained soft. Inflation has increased
somewhat since earlier this year but is still below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run
objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most surveybased measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent
months.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the
stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market
conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the
medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and
the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly
balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic
and financial developments.
Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal
funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further
evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains
accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return
to 2 percent inflation.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into
account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international
developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will
carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects
that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the
federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are
expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed
securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so
until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help
maintain accommodative financial conditions.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C.
Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Jerome H. Powell; Eric
Rosengren; and Daniel K. Tarullo. Voting against the action were: Esther L. George and Loretta
J. Mester, each of whom preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds
rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on November 2, 2016:
•

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System left unchanged the interest rate
paid on required and excess reserve balances at 0.50 percent.

•

As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and
direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed
otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance
with the following domestic policy directive:
“Effective November 3, 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk
to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in
a target range of 1/4 to 1/2 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations
(and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an
offering rate of 0.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury
securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for
such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities
at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and
agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The
Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap
transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency
mortgage-backed securities transactions.”
More information regarding open market operations may be found on the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York’s website.

•

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System took no action to change the
discount rate (the primary credit rate), which remains at 1.00 percent.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market
Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve’s operational
tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.
