Developments in Financial Markets and Open
Market Operations
The manager of the System Open Market Account
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Committee met on April 26–27, 2016. Market participants’
expectations for a firming of monetary policy at the June
FOMC meeting rose considerably in the middle of the
period, largely in response to monetary policy communications, but those expectations subsequently fell
sharply following the release of labor market data for
May. Nominal yields on Treasury securities declined
over the period. Forward measures of inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflationindexed Treasury securities fell despite an appreciable increase in crude oil prices, a development that contrasted
with the positive correlation between these variables that
had been evident for some time. The manager also
noted that bond yields globally had declined to very low
levels and discussed some of the possible reasons for the
drop. Actions by investors to shift their portfolios away
from very low-yielding foreign sovereign debt were cited
as adding to the downward pressure on U.S. yields. The
manager also reviewed the apparent effects on financial
markets of changes in the perceived odds that the United
Kingdom would vote in a referendum on June 23 to
leave the European Union.
In domestic money markets, the effective federal funds
rate once again stayed close to the middle of the
FOMC’s ¼ to ½ percent target range over the intermeeting period except on month-ends. Usage of the
System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility
remained low. Market participants anticipated that
changes to the regulation of money market mutual funds
that will take effect later in the year could lead to some
increase in usage of the facility. Finally, the manager
briefed the Committee on various efforts, including
small-value tests of System facilities, to enhance operational readiness.
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the June 14–15 meeting
indicated that the pace of improvement in labor market
conditions slowed in April and May but that real gross
domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising faster
than in the first quarter. Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases
in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.
Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were mixed in recent months, while market-based
measures of inflation compensation declined from levels
that were already low.
Total nonfarm payroll employment gains slowed in April
and May, even after adjusting for the effects of a strike
at a large telecommunications company. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent in May, partly reflecting an unusually large number of unemployed persons
exiting the labor force. Over the first two months of the
second quarter, both the labor force participation rate
and the employment-to-population ratio moved down
on net. The share of workers employed part time for
economic reasons rose noticeably in May. Although the
rate of private-sector job openings remained elevated,
the rate of hires declined in both March and April and
the rate of quits was unchanged. The four-week moving
average of initial claims for unemployment insurance
benefits moved up a little, on net, from late April to early
June but was still at a low level. Labor productivity
growth remained slow over the four quarters ending in
the first quarter of 2016. Measures of labor compensation continued to rise at a moderate pace on balance:
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector
increased 3¾ percent over the four quarters ending in
the first quarter, the employment cost index for private
workers rose 1¾ percent over the 12 months ending in
March, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in May.
The unemployment rates for African Americans and for
Hispanics stayed above the rate for whites, although the
differentials in jobless rates across the different groups
were similar to those before the most recent recession.
The share of African American and Hispanic workers
employed part time for economic reasons remained
higher than for whites, and the gap in these rates was
wider than in the years just before the most recent recession.

Total industrial production (IP) rose in April, principally
reflecting a rebound in the output of utilities following a
couple of unseasonably warm winter months as well as
a moderate increase in manufacturing production.
Meanwhile, mining output continued to contract as a result of further declines in drilling activity, a slower pace
of crude oil extraction, and a continued pullback in coal
production. A variety of indicators—including manufacturing production worker hours, motor vehicle assemblies, and oil and gas extraction and drilling activity—suggested that IP likely declined in May. Automakers’ assembly schedules and mixed readings on other indicators of manufacturing production, such as new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys,
pointed to only subdued gains in factory output over the
next few months.
Growth in real personal consumption expenditures
(PCE) appeared to be picking up in the second quarter.
The components of the nominal retail sales data used by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE rose at a solid pace in April and May, and
sales of light motor vehicles rebounded after dipping in
March. The apparent pickup in real PCE growth was
consistent with recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending. Gains in real disposable personal income continued to be solid in March and April,
and households’ net worth was boosted by further
strong increases in home values through April. Also,
consumer sentiment as measured by the University of
Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained upbeat in
early June.
Recent information on housing activity was broadly consistent with a continued gradual recovery in this sector.
Starts for new single-family homes increased in April but
were below the average pace in the first quarter, and
building permit issuance remained essentially flat at the
level that prevailed since late last year. The pace of starts
for multifamily units moved up in April and was faster
than in the first quarter. Sales of both new and existing
homes rose in April.
Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to be relatively flat early in
the second quarter after declining sharply in the previous
quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital
goods excluding aircraft edged up in April, and forwardlooking indicators, such as new orders for these capital
goods and recent readings from national and regional
surveys of business conditions, suggested little change in
business equipment spending in the near term. Firms’

Page 4

nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining was little changed, on net, in
March and April. The number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the
drilling and mining sector, fell through late May but
edged up in early June.
Total real government purchases rose modestly in the
first quarter and appeared to be increasing at about the
same pace in the second quarter. Nominal outlays for
defense in April and May pointed to an increase in real
federal purchases in the second quarter, after such purchases had declined in the first quarter. In contrast, real
state and local government purchases seemed to be edging down in the second quarter; the payrolls of these
governments were little changed, on net, in April and
May, and their nominal spending for construction declined in April.
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in March, with a sharp decline in imports more than
offsetting a fall in exports. The March data, together
with revised estimates for earlier months, suggested that
real exports were about flat in the first quarter while imports fell slightly. In April, the deficit widened as imports recovered somewhat, but it remained narrower
than its first-quarter average.
Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE
price index, increased about 1 percent over the
12 months ending in April, partly restrained by earlier
declines in consumer energy prices. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy
prices, was a little above 1½ percent over the same
12-month period, held down in part by decreases in the
prices of non-energy imports over much of this period
and the pass-through of the declines in energy prices to
prices of other goods and services. Over the 12 months
ending in April, total consumer prices as measured by
the consumer price index (CPI) also rose about 1 percent, while core CPI inflation was a little above 2 percent. The Michigan survey measure of longer-run inflation expectations fell to its lowest level on record in early
June, but other measures of such expectations—including those from the Survey of Professional Forecasters
and from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were generally little
changed, on balance, in recent months.
Foreign real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter,
supported by relatively robust increases in Canada, the
euro area, Japan, and Mexico. However, the pace of
growth appeared to slow in many foreign economies in
the second quarter, although in some cases as a result of

what were likely to be temporary disruptions, including
wildfires in Canada and an earthquake in Japan. In the
United Kingdom, uncertainty about the outcome of the
referendum on exit from the European Union seemed
to be holding down investment. In contrast, indicators
for emerging Asia, including China, suggested that economic growth picked up in the second quarter. Inflation
remained low in the advanced foreign economies
(AFEs), in part reflecting previous declines in energy
prices. Inflation also continued to be subdued in most
emerging market economies (EMEs).
Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Domestic financial market conditions remained accommodative over the intermeeting period. Equity price indexes and corporate bond spreads were little changed,
on net, and, in aggregate, corporations continued to tap
credit markets at a solid pace. Credit also remained
broadly available to households, except for higher-risk
borrowers in some markets. The expected near-term
path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes
varied notably over the intermeeting period. On balance, it flattened, largely in response to the disappointing
May employment report and growing concerns among
investors about the British referendum on membership
in the European Union. The flatter expected path of the
federal funds rate, along with an apparent decline in
global risk sentiment early in the period, contributed to
an appreciable reduction in longer-term Treasury yields.
Market-based estimates of the probability of a hike in the
federal funds rate at the June FOMC meeting were variable during the intermeeting period. The probability of
an increase in June fell to near zero in early May in response to incoming economic data, jumped to about
30 percent after the release of the April FOMC minutes
and other Federal Reserve communications, and
dropped again to near zero after the May employment
report. The expected path of the federal funds rate for
the medium term implied by market quotes declined
somewhat on net. The average probability assigned by
respondents to the Desk’s June Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants was near zero for
a rate hike in June and around 20 percent for a rate increase in July. The median respondent in each survey
indicated that the most likely outcome was only one hike
in 2016, down from two in the April surveys.
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened, on net, over
the intermeeting period, mainly reflecting declines in
longer-term rates; the flattening left the spread between
yields on 2- and 10-year Treasury securities near its lowest level since 2007. Although a significant portion of

Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2016
Page 5
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

the declines in yields occurred following the release of
the May employment report, yields at longer maturities
had begun drifting down earlier in the period, consistent
with an apparent deterioration in global risk sentiment.
Yields moved lower late in the period amid growing concerns about the upcoming British referendum. Some
market participants attributed the decline in Treasury
yields in part to heavy demand from foreign investors
faced with extraordinarily low yields on foreign sovereign securities. Inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) decreased, particularly at longer tenors. Measures of inflation compensation based on inflation swaps also declined, but less
than TIPS-based measures, consistent with anecdotal reports suggesting that a portion of the declines in TIPSbased measures might have been driven by elevated demand for longer-term nominal Treasury securities.
Broad stock price indexes moved within narrow ranges
but were modestly lower, on net, over the intermeeting
period. However, one-month-ahead option-implied
volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—rose notably
from fairly low levels and ended the period close to its
historical median level. Spreads of 10-year triple-B-rated
corporate bond yields over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed on balance.
High-yield spreads widened, mainly for firms outside of
the energy sector; spreads on bonds for firms in the energy sector narrowed, likely in response to rising oil
prices.
Overall financing conditions for nonfinancial firms improved a bit over the intermeeting period, remaining accommodative. Amid still-low yields, bond issuance by
investment-grade corporations rose to a robust pace in
May, and speculative-grade issuance also picked up.
Growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on
banks’ books remained strong in April and May, particularly at large banks. Following significant declines in
the first quarter of 2016, gross issuance of leveraged
loans increased slightly in April and May, as refinancing
was reportedly boosted by lower loan spreads. Equity
issuance by nonfinancial firms through initial public offerings remained subdued over the intermeeting period.
Meanwhile, nonfinancial firms continued to repurchase
their shares at a brisk pace in the first quarter, and dividends stayed near record levels.
Recent developments pointed to some decline in the
credit quality of nonfinancial firms. The percentage of
C&I loans entering delinquency or being charged off increased further in the first quarter, the default rate of
corporate bonds moved up in April, and downgrades of

nonfinancial bonds significantly outpaced upgrades in
May. Expected year-ahead default rates for nonfinancial
firms remained moderately elevated relative to previous
expansions, while those for oil companies continued to
be high.
Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained fairly accommodative. All major categories of
commercial real estate loans on banks’ books increased
briskly during April and May. However, spreads on
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stayed
elevated, continuing to depress CMBS issuance.
On balance, credit conditions in municipal bond markets
continued to be stable. Yield spreads on general obligation municipal bonds were little changed, and gross issuance remained solid. The default by Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank on debt payments due in
early May was widely expected and elicited limited reaction in broader municipal bond markets.
Conditions in consumer credit markets were little
changed and generally remained accommodative. Consumer loan balances continued to increase at a robust
pace in recent months, with year-over-year growth in
credit card balances outstanding continuing to trend upward. Credit in mortgage markets stayed tight for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or high debt-to-income ratios. Interest rates on
30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined and continued to
be low by historical standards.
Over the intermeeting period, developments in global financial markets were driven in large part by shifting
views on the expected path of U.S. monetary policy and
by fluctuating expectations about the outcome of the
U.K. vote on membership in the European Union. The
exchange value of the U.S. dollar rose in the middle of
the intermeeting period along with expectations for less
accommodative Federal Reserve monetary policy. However, the dollar partially retraced these increases following the much weaker-than-expected U.S. employment
report for May, finishing the period a bit stronger against
the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher
against EME currencies. In contrast to its changes
against most currencies, the dollar depreciated against
the Japanese yen, in large part because of the unexpected
decision by the Bank of Japan not to ease policy further
at its April meeting. AFE sovereign yields declined, with
U.K. yields in particular being weighed down following
polls showing an increase in support for the “leave” vote
in the upcoming referendum. Decreases in equity indexes in the AFEs, particularly in Europe, also report-

edly reflected concerns about the possibility of a successful “leave” vote. Most EME equity markets also edged
lower.
Staff Economic Outlook
In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for
the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was estimated to have been faster in the first quarter than in the
April forecast, and the incoming information was consistent with a moderate pickup in GDP growth in the
second quarter. Real GDP was projected to rise a little
slower in the second half of this year than in the previous
forecast and to increase at about the same pace thereafter; the small boosts to real GDP growth implied by a
lower assumed path for interest rates and by a slightly
stronger trajectory for home values were essentially offset by restraint from higher projected paths for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and for oil prices. The
staff continued to forecast that real GDP would expand
at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2016
through 2018, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending. The unemployment rate was expected
to remain relatively flat over the second half of the year
and then to gradually decline further; over this period,
the unemployment rate was projected to run somewhat
below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed from
the previous projection. The staff continued to project
that inflation would increase over the next several years,
as energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports
were expected to begin steadily rising this year. However, inflation was still projected to be slightly below the
Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2018.
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its April projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and
inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.
The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted
to the downside, reflecting the staff’s assessment that
neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to
help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks.
In addition, the staff continued to see the risks to the
forecast from developments abroad as skewed to the
downside. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for
the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. The risks
to the projection for inflation were still judged as
weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that

conjunction with the June 2016 FOMC meeting.

longer-term inflation expectations may have edged
down.
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the
Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from
2016 through 2018 and over the longer run. 4 Each participant’s projections were conditioned on his or her
judgment of appropriate monetary policy. The longerrun projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the
economy. These projections and policy assessments are
described in the Summary of Economic Projections,
which is an addendum to these minutes.
In their discussion of the economic situation and the
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the
pace of improvement in the labor market had slowed
while growth in economic activity appeared to have
picked up. Although the unemployment rate had declined, job gains had diminished. Growth in household
spending had strengthened. Since the beginning of the
year, the housing sector had continued to improve and
the drag from net exports appeared to have lessened, but
business fixed investment had been soft. Inflation had
continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent
longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in
energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined;
most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent
months.
Participants generally expected that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market
indicators would strengthen. Inflation was expected to
remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier
declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over
the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further. Participants generally
agreed that the Committee should continue to closely

Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2016
Page 7
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
Growth of consumer spending appeared to have picked
up from its slow pace in the first quarter. Retail sales
posted strong gains in April and May, and sales of light
motor vehicles moved back up. At the time of the April
meeting, most participants had anticipated a rebound in
consumer spending in light of the still-solid fundamental
determinants of household spending. Some participants
indicated that consumption was likely to continue being
supported by these factors, which included ongoing
gains in income, robust household balance sheets, and
the positive assessment of current economic conditions
that was evident in recent surveys of consumers. However, a few participants expressed caution about the outlook for consumer expenditures, noting that slower increases in employment and higher energy prices could
restrain spending.
The housing sector continued to improve since the beginning of the year. Reports from a number of participants indicated that single-family construction was
strengthening and house prices were rising in most parts
of their Districts. However, some areas that were affected by the slowdown in the energy sector experienced
house price declines or increases in mortgage delinquency rates.
Participants summarized survey readings and anecdotal
reports on business conditions in their Districts. Those
indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic
activity within the manufacturing sector. Some of the
weakness in manufacturing activity was linked to the effects of earlier declines in oil prices on firms in the energy sector and to previous increases in the exchange
value of the dollar, which had adversely affected exporters. But manufacturing activity was judged to have stabilized in a couple of Districts, and contacts there were
optimistic about further improvement in the months
ahead. It was noted that the recent increase in crude oil
prices had improved the outlook for the energy sector.
However, a couple of participants observed that financial strains caused by previous declines in energy prices
had continued for firms or financial institutions in their
Districts, and such difficulties were seen as likely to persist absent further increases in energy prices. Regarding
the service sector, a few participants commented that activity and hiring continued to expand in their Districts.
The near-term outlook for farm income remained weak
despite recent increases in the futures prices of some agricultural commodities.

Available indicators suggested that the softness in business fixed investment since late last year persisted early
in the second quarter. While weakness in the drilling and
mining sector was attributable to the earlier declines in
oil prices, participants identified a variety of potential
causes of the broader weakness in investment spending,
including a slowdown in corporate profits, concern
about prospects for economic growth, heightened uncertainty regarding the future course of domestic regulatory and fiscal policies, and a persistent reluctance on the
part of firms to undertake new projects in the wake of
the financial crisis. Some participants mentioned that
the sluggishness in business investment could portend a
broader economic slowdown. A couple of participants
also noted that elevated inventory levels could be a drag
on economic growth in the near term. However, participants also cited factors that could lead to a pickup in
business spending, including the recent turnaround in
energy prices and the greater optimism on the part of
firms indicated by surveys of businesses and anecdotal
reports in some Districts.
The employment report for May showed considerably
weaker growth in payrolls than had been expected, and
gains in previous months were revised down. Although
the unemployment rate fell in May, a drop in labor force
participation accounted for the decline. Participants discussed a range of interpretations of these data. Many
participants observed that, because of transitory factors,
such as statistical noise and the effects of a strike in the
telecommunications industry, the reported rate of payroll job growth likely understated its underlying pace;
however, many participants thought that the underlying
pace had slowed some from that of previous months.
Some noted that other indicators did not corroborate a
material weakening of labor market conditions. These
indicators included a number of regional surveys of labor market conditions, relatively low levels of initial
claims for unemployment insurance, surveys of business
hiring plans, and positive views of labor market conditions in recent consumer surveys. In addition, a few participants commented that the movements in labor force
participation in recent months were, on balance, consistent with its secular downtrend. In contrast, some
noted that the lower rate of payroll gains could instead
be indicative of a broader slowdown in growth of economic activity that was also evidenced by other downbeat labor market indicators, such as a decline in the diffusion indexes of industry payrolls, an increase in the
number of workers reporting that they were working
part time for economic reasons, or the recent sharp drop
in labor force participation. Finally, a few participants

Page 8
Federal Open Market Committee
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

suggested that the weak employment growth may instead reflect supply constraints associated with a general
tightening of labor market conditions. These participants saw the rising trend in wages, business reports of
reduced worker availability, and high rate of job openings as supporting this interpretation. Others thought it
unlikely that such constraints would have become evident so abruptly.
Almost all participants judged that the surprisingly weak
May employment report increased their uncertainty
about the outlook for the labor market. Even so, many
remarked that they were reluctant to change their outlook materially based on one economic data release. Participants generally expected to see a resumption of
monthly gains in payroll employment that would be sufficient to promote continued strengthening of the labor
market. However, some noted that with labor market
conditions at or near those consistent with maximum
employment, it would be reasonable to anticipate that
gains in payroll employment would soon moderate from
the pace seen over the past few years.
Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Core PCE price inflation registered an increase of
1.6 percent for the 12 months ending in April, while recent readings on retail energy prices moved up notably.
Most participants expected to see continued progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.
They viewed the firming in some measures of core inflation, the evidence that wage growth was picking up, the
ongoing tightening of resource utilization, the recent
firming in oil prices, and the stabilization of the foreign
exchange value of the dollar this year as factors likely to
boost inflation over time. However, other participants
were less confident that inflation would return to its target level over the medium term. They thought that progress could be very slow, particularly in light of the likelihood that tighter resource utilization may impart only
modest upward pressure on prices. They also saw important downside risks, including persistent disinflationary pressures from very low inflation and weak economic growth abroad as well as the softening in some
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations and market-based measures of inflation compensation.
Global financial conditions had improved since earlier in
the year, and recent data on net exports suggested that
the drag on domestic economic activity from the exter-

nal sector had abated somewhat. Still, participants generally agreed that global economic and financial developments should continue to be monitored closely.
Some participants indicated that prospects for economic
activity in many foreign economies appeared to be subdued, that global inflation and interest rates remained
very low by historical standards, and that recurring bouts
of global financial market instability remained a risk.
Most participants noted that the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union could
generate financial market turbulence that could adversely affect domestic economic performance. Some
also noted that continued uncertainty regarding the outlook for China’s foreign exchange policy and the relatively high levels of debt in China and some other EMEs
represented appreciable risks to global financial stability
and economic performance.
In light of participants’ updates to their economic projections, they discussed their current assessments of the
appropriate trajectory of monetary policy over the medium term. Most still expected that the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate associated with their
projections of further progress toward the Committee’s
statutory objectives would rise gradually in coming years.
However, some noted that their forecasts were now consistent with a shallower path than they had expected at
the time of the March meeting. Many participants commented that the level of the federal funds rate consistent
with maintaining trend economic growth—the so-called
neutral rate—appeared to be lower currently or was
likely to be lower in the longer run than they had estimated earlier. While recognizing that the longer-run
neutral rate was highly uncertain, many judged that it
would likely remain low relative to historical standards,
held down by factors such as slow productivity growth
and demographic trends. Several noted that in the prevailing circumstances of considerable uncertainty about
the neutral federal funds rate, the Committee could better gauge the effects of increases in the federal funds rate
on the economy if it proceeded gradually in adjusting
policy.
Participants weighed a number of considerations in assessing the conditions under which it would be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds
rate. Most participants indicated that they made only
small changes to their forecasts for achieving and maintaining the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation over the medium term.
Several noted that the fundamentals underlying their
forecasts remained solid, with several mentioning, in
particular, that financial conditions were accommodative

and household balance sheets had improved. In evaluating recent economic information, participants generally agreed that it was advisable to avoid overreacting to
one or two labor market reports; however, the implications of the recent data on labor market conditions for
the economic outlook were uncertain. Most judged that
they would need to accumulate additional information
on the labor market, production, and spending to help
clarify how the economy was evolving in order to evaluate whether the stance of monetary policy should be adjusted. In addition, participants generally thought that it
would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom on membership
in the European Union in order to assess the consequences of the vote for global financial market conditions and the U.S. economic outlook.
Most participants judged that, in the absence of significant economic or financial shocks, raising the target
range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate if
incoming information confirmed that economic growth
had picked up, that job gains were continuing at a pace
sufficient to sustain progress toward the Committee’s
maximum-employment objective, and that inflation was
likely to rise to 2 percent over the medium term. Some
participants viewed a broad range of labor market indicators as well as the recent firming in wages as consistent
with a high level of labor utilization. They also pointed
out that core inflation had begun to move up and that
the transitory factors that had been holding down headline inflation were receding. Several of these participants
expressed concern that a delay in resuming further gradual increases in the federal funds rate would increase the
risks to financial stability or would raise the potential for
overshooting the Committee’s objectives; such an overshooting might require a rapid removal of policy accommodation at some point in the future, which could entail
significant risks for U.S. financial markets and the economy.
However, some other participants were uncertain
whether economic conditions would soon warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. Several of them noted downside risks to the outlook for
growth in economic activity and for further improvement in labor market conditions, including the possibility that the sharp slowdown in employment gains and
the continued weakness in business fixed investment signaled a downshift in economic growth, as well as the potential for global economic or financial shocks. Moreover, several of them worried about the declines in
measures of inflation compensation and in some surveybased measures of inflation expectations and suggested

that monetary policy may need to remain accommodative for some time in order to move inflation closer to
2 percent on a sustained basis. A few pointed out that
with inflation likely to remain low for some time and to
rise only gradually, maintaining an accommodative
stance of policy could extend the strengthening of the
labor market. In addition, several participants observed
that because short-term interest rates were still near zero,
monetary policy could, if necessary, respond more effectively to surprisingly strong inflationary pressures in the
future than to a weakening in the labor market and falling inflation.
A number of participants emphasized that the Committee’s approach to policy-setting was necessarily data dependent given the uncertainties associated with mediumterm forecasts of economic activity and, accordingly,
with the appropriate policy path over the medium term.
It was noted that their expectations for the federal funds
rate did not represent a preset plan and could change as
incoming information influenced their views of the economic outlook and the risks associated with it. Several
participants expressed concern that the Committee’s
communications had not been fully effective in informing the public how incoming information affected the
Committee’s view of the economic outlook, its degree
of confidence in the outlook, or the implications for the
trajectory of monetary policy.
Committee Policy Action
In their consideration of monetary policy for the period
ahead, members judged that the information received
since the Committee met in April indicated that the pace
of improvement in labor market conditions had slowed
in recent months while growth in economic activity appeared to have picked up from the low rates recorded in
the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
Although the unemployment rate had declined over the
intermeeting period, job gains had diminished. After
only a modest increase early in the year, growth in household spending had strengthened in recent months. Since
the beginning of the year, the housing sector had continued to improve and the drag from net exports had lessened, but business fixed investment had been soft. Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices
and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based
measures of inflation compensation declined over the
intermeeting period; most survey-based measures of inflation expectations were little changed.
With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect

Page 10
Federal Open Market Committee
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate
pace and labor market indicators would strengthen.
Most members made only small changes to their forecasts for economic activity and the labor market. Most
judged it appropriate to avoid overweighting one or two
labor market reports in their consideration of the economic outlook, but they indicated that the recent slowing in payroll employment gains had increased their uncertainty about the likely pace of improvements in the
labor market going forward. Many noted that the slowdown could be a temporary aberration and that other labor market indicators—such as new claims for unemployment insurance, the rate of job openings, and readings on consumers’ perceptions of the labor market—
remained positive. Some of them judged that labor market conditions were now at or close to the Committee’s
objectives and pointed out that some moderation in employment gains was to be expected when such conditions were near those consistent with maximum employment. However, other members observed that the recent soft readings on payroll jobs as well as the decline
in the labor force participation rate and the absence of
further reductions in the number of individuals who
were working part time for economic reasons in recent
months suggested a possible downshift in the pace of
improvement in the labor market.
An additional factor in the Committee’s policy deliberations was the upcoming U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union. Members noted the considerable uncertainty about the outcome of the vote and
its potential economic and financial market consequences. They indicated that they would closely monitor
developments associated with the referendum as well as
other global economic and financial developments that
could affect the U.S. outlook.
Members expected inflation to remain low in the near
term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices,
but most anticipated that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of
past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and
the labor market strengthened further. Although headline inflation continued to run below the Committee’s
objective, some members observed that core inflation
had risen, and one member noted that the annual rate of
increase in core PCE inflation in the first quarter had
exceeded 2 percent. However, several others continued
to see downside risks to inflation, citing the decline in
inflation expectations and the risk of adverse shocks to
U.S. economic activity from developments abroad. In
light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent,

the Committee agreed to continue carefully monitoring
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.
After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and after weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to
leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at ¼ to ½ percent at this meeting. Members
generally agreed that, before assessing whether another
step in removing monetary accommodation was warranted, it was prudent to wait for additional data regarding labor market conditions as well as information that
would allow them to assess the consequences of the
U.K. vote for global financial conditions and the U.S.
economic outlook. They judged that their decisions
about the appropriate level of the federal funds rate in
coming months would depend importantly on whether
incoming information corroborated the Committee’s expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and
inflation. Some of them emphasized that, with labor
market conditions and inflation at or close to the Committee’s objectives, taking another step in removing
monetary accommodation should not be delayed too
long. However, a couple of members underscored that
they would need to accumulate sufficient evidence to increase their confidence that economic growth was
strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock
to demand and that inflation was moving closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.
Members reiterated that, in determining the timing and
size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and
expected economic conditions relative to its objectives
of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This
assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international
developments. The Committee expected that economic
conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and the
federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time,
below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer
run. Members emphasized that the actual path of the
federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. In that regard, they
judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy
options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the
stance of policy based on how incoming information affected the Committee’s assessment of the outlook for
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation as well
as the risks to the outlook.

The Committee also decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over
maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipated doing so until normalization of the federal funds
rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the
following domestic policy directive, to be released at
2:00 p.m.:
“Effective June 16, 2016, the Federal Open
Market Committee directs the Desk to
undertake open market operations as necessary
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target
range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse
repurchase operations with maturities of more
than one day when necessary to accommodate
weekend, holiday, or similar trading
conventions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent,
in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury
securities held outright in the System Open
Market Account that are available for such
operations and by a per-counterparty limit of
$30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee also directs the Desk
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed
securities transactions.”
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
“Information received since the Federal Open
Market Committee met in April indicates that
the pace of improvement in the labor market
has slowed while growth in economic activity
appears to have picked up. Although the
unemployment rate has declined, job gains have

diminished. Growth in household spending has
strengthened. Since the beginning of the year,
the housing sector has continued to improve
and the drag from net exports appears to have
lessened, but business fixed investment has
been soft. Inflation has continued to run below
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective,
partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices
and in prices of non-energy imports. Marketbased measures of inflation compensation
declined; most survey-based measures of
longer-term inflation expectations are little
changed, on balance, in recent months.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the
Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability.
The
Committee currently expects that, with gradual
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy,
economic activity will expand at a moderate
pace and labor market indicators will
strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low
in the near term, in part because of earlier
declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent
over the medium term as the transitory effects
of past declines in energy and import prices
dissipate and the labor market strengthens
further. The Committee continues to closely
monitor inflation indicators and global
economic and financial developments.
Against this backdrop, the Committee decided
to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The stance of
monetary policy remains accommodative,
thereby supporting further improvement in
labor market conditions and a return to
2 percent inflation.
In determining the timing and size of future
adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized
and expected economic conditions relative to its
objectives of maximum employment and
2 percent inflation. This assessment will take
into account a wide range of information,
including measures of labor market conditions,
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation
expectations, and readings on financial and
international developments. In light of the
current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the
Committee will carefully monitor actual and
expected progress toward its inflation goal. The

Page 12

Committee expects that economic conditions
will evolve in a manner that will warrant only
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in
the longer run. However, the actual path of the
federal funds rate will depend on the economic
outlook as informed by incoming data.
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy
of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury
securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so
until normalization of the level of the federal
funds rate is well under way. This policy, by

Summary of Economic Projections
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June 14–15, 2016, meeting
participants submitted their projections of the most
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each
year from 2016 to 2018 and over the longer run. 1 Each
participant’s projection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her
assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable
would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further
shocks to the economy. “Appropriate monetary policy”
is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic
activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual
interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of
maximum employment and stable prices.
FOMC participants generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic
product (GDP) this year, next year, and in 2018 would
be at or quite close to their individual estimates of GDP
growth over the longer run. All but a few participants
projected that the unemployment rate at the end of this
year will be at or below its longer-run normal rate and
expected it to edge lower next year. For 2018, nearly all
participants expected the unemployment rate to be at or
a bit below its longer-run level. Almost all participants
projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter
percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase this year
and over the next two years, and most expected inflation
to have converged to the Committee’s objective of
2 percent by 2018. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections.
As shown in figure 2, almost all participants expected
that it would be appropriate for the target range for the
federal funds rate to rise gradually as the economy steadily progresses toward the Committee’s longer-run goals
of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Indeed, participants generally judged that the federal funds
rate in 2018 would still be below their estimates of its

longer-run rate. However, because the economic outlook is inherently uncertain, participants’ assessments of
appropriate policy were also uncertain and likely would
change in response to revisions to their economic outlooks and associated risks.
Participants generally viewed the level of uncertainty associated with their individual forecasts for economic
growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar
to the norms of the previous 20 years. Most participants
also judged the risks around their projections for economic activity and inflation as broadly balanced, although many participants saw the risks to their GDP
growth and inflation forecasts as weighted to the downside. In addition, some participants viewed the risks to
their forecasts of the unemployment rate as tilted to the
upside.
The Outlook for Economic Activity
The median of participants’ projections for the growth
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was
2 percent for each year from 2016 through 2018, the
same as the median of their projections of the longerrun GDP growth rate. However, a majority of participants expected that real GDP growth would pick up a
bit in 2017 from this year’s pace, and most expected it to
remain at or above their estimates of its longer-run pace
in 2018. Participants pointed to a number of factors that
they expected would contribute to moderate output
growth over the next few years, including a diminution
of the drag on net exports from a strong dollar, the continued improvements in household and business balance
sheets, accommodative financial conditions, and somewhat more supportive fiscal policy.
Participants’ median projections for real GDP growth in
2016 and 2017 were slightly lower than the medians
shown in the March 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Participants who lowered their projections for near-term GDP growth generally attributed
their revisions to weaker-than-expected growth in the
first quarter and soft readings on economic activity in
recent months, particularly those on business spending.
Although several participants also reduced their forecasts for real GDP growth in 2018 and in the longer run,

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inﬂation are percent changes from the
fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inﬂation and core PCE inﬂation are the percentage rates of change
in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for
the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are
based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each
variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the
federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target
level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer run. The March projections were made in conjunction with
the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 15–16, 2016. One participant did not submit longer-run projections in conjunction with
the June 14–15, 2016 meeting.

those downward revisions did not alter the median forecasts.
The median of projections for the unemployment rate
edged down from 4.7 percent at the end of 2016 to
4.6 percent in 2017 and remained at that level in 2018,
modestly below the median assessment of the longerrun normal unemployment rate of 4.8 percent. The medians and ranges of the unemployment rate projections
for 2016 to 2018 were nearly unchanged from March.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2016 through 2018 and in the longer
run. The distribution of individual projections of GDP
growth for 2016 shifted lower relative to the distribution
of the March projections. The distributions of projections for GDP growth over the next two years and in the
longer run also shifted down. For this year and next, the
distributions of projections for the unemployment rate
were little changed, while the distribution for 2018 became less dispersed.
The Outlook for Inflation
In the June SEP, the median of projections for headline
PCE price inflation in 2016 was 1.4 percent, a bit higher
than in March. Many participants pointed to strongerthan-expected readings on inflation early this year, as
well as to the recent stabilization of oil prices, as factors
contributing to the upward revision to their inflation
projections. The projections for headline PCE price inflation over the next two years and in the longer run were
little changed since March, with the median inflation
projection still rising to 1.9 percent in 2017 and to the
Committee’s objective of 2 percent in 2018. Almost all
participants projected that inflation will be within
0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s objective by
2018. The median of individual projections for core
PCE price inflation also increases gradually over the next
two years.
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distribution of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation. The distribution of projections for headline PCE
price inflation for this year shifted up relative to projections for the March meeting. The distribution of projections for core PCE price inflation this year also moved
2 One

participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, GDP
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed
by the view that there are multiple possible medium-term regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent,
and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way that

to the right on balance. For 2017 and 2018, the distributions of projections for both total and core PCE price
inflation were nearly unchanged.
Appropriate Monetary Policy
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target
federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2016 to
2018 and over the longer run. 2 The distributions for
2016 to 2018 and for the longer run shifted to the left.
The median projection for the federal funds rate rises
gradually from 0.88 percent at the end of 2016 to
1.63 percent at the end of 2017 and 2.38 percent at the
end of 2018; the median for the longer-run projections
of the federal funds rate is 3 percent. Although the median federal funds rate at the end of 2016 was unchanged
from the March projection, a majority of participants revised down their projections for that year, most by
0.25 percentage point. For 2017 and 2018, the median
projections were 0.25 percentage point and 0.62 percentage point lower, respectively, than in March.
Compared with the March SEP, the median of participants’ projections for the federal funds rate in the longer
run moved down 0.25 percentage point. This change
reflected downward revisions by about half of the participants.
Participants’ projections for the path of the federal funds
rate represented their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy consistent with their projections
of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other
factors. In discussing their June forecasts, many participants expressed a view that increases in the federal funds
rate over the next several years would need to be gradual
in light of a short-term neutral interest rate that was currently low—a phenomenon that several participants attributed to the persistence of factors that restrained
spending over recent years—and that was likely to rise
only slowly as the effects of those factors faded over

policy normalization. Participants cited a number of factors that pushed down their projections of the longerrun rate, including domestic and global demographic
trends and weak productivity growth, which together
imply a slower pace of trend output growth.
Uncertainty and Risks
The left-hand column of figure 4 shows that all but a few
participants judged the levels of uncertainty around their
June projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and headline and core PCE price inflation to
be broadly similar to the average levels of the past
20 years. 3 A few participants saw the uncertainty about
GDP growth as higher than its historical average, up
from only one in March. These participants cited the
surprisingly weak productivity growth of recent years or
the continuing fragile nature of the global economic environment as supporting such a view. Most participants’
assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their
economic projections did not change materially from
March.
As in March, most participants judged the risks to their
projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate
to be broadly balanced, although many still assessed the
risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside and
some saw the risks to the unemployment rate as tilted to
the upside (top two panels in the right-hand column of
figure 4). Participants who saw the risks to growth as
tilted to the downside attributed this assessment to the
weaker-than-expected May employment report; recent
softness in business fixed investment; concerns about
the global economic environment, including possible
economic and financial consequences of the upcoming
British referendum on European Union membership; or
the proximity of short-term nominal interest rates to the

effective lower bound. A majority of participants judged
the risks to their inflation projections to be broadly balanced. However, many viewed the risks to inflation as
skewed to the downside, although fewer than in March.
A couple of participants pointed to the firming of some
measures of inflation in recent months as contributing
to the change in their risk assessment. Among those
who continued to judge that the risks to inflation were
weighted to the downside, almost all cited recent declines in measures of inflation compensation and some
survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations as reasons for that assessment.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Forecast Uncertainty
The economic projections provided by the
members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers
and can aid public understanding of the basis for
policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends
these projections, however. The economic and
statistical models and relationships used to help
produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future
path of the economy can be affected by myriad
unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in
setting the stance of monetary policy, participants
consider not only what appears to be the most
likely economic outcome as embodied in their
projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the
potential costs to the economy should they occur.
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those
prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in
advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market
Committee. The projection error ranges shown in
the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example,
suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices
will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively,
3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced
in the past and the risks around the projections are
broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2
would imply a probability of about 70 percent that
actual GDP would expand within a range of
1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.0 to

5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would
be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and 1.0 to
3.0 percent in the second and third years.
Because current conditions may differ from
those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar
to typical levels of forecast uncertainty in the past,
as shown in table 2. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections
are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the
downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, participants judge whether each variable is more likely to
be above or below their projections of the most
likely outcome. These judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attending each participant’s
projections are distinct from the diversity of participants’ views about the most likely outcomes.
Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than
with divergences across a number of different projections.
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook
for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty
arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy
depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions
evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments
of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate
would change from that point forward.
