 discussion economic situation outlook, meeting participants
 indicated still saw moderate economic expansion coming quarters
 likely outcome downside risks growth increased. Participants
 reported economic expansion continued moderate pace many regions
 country despite weakness housing sector. Going forward,
 participants anticipated growth aggregate demand would supported
 rising employment, incomes, exports, result growth actual output
 probably would remain close growth potential GDP despite ongoing
 adjustment housing sector. Several mentioned revisions NIPA
 pointed modest downward adjustment projected growth actual potential
 GDP, thought potential output growth likely bit higher
 forecast staff. However, recent spending indicators mixed, credit
 conditions become tighter, suggesting greater downside risks growth.
 Participants generally expected core inflation would edge lower next two
 years, reflecting slight easing pressures resources, well-anchored inflation
 expectations, waning temporary factors boosted prices last year
 early year. Participants anticipated total inflation would slow well,
 particularly market expectations modest decline energy prices coming
 quarters prove correct. concerned high level
 resource utilization slower productivity growth could augment inflation
 pressures. backdrop, Committee agreed risk inflation
 would fail moderate expected remained predominant policy concern.
 Participants agreed housing sector apt remain drag growth
 time represented significant downside risk economic outlook.
 Indeed, developments mortgage markets intermeeting period suggested
 adjustment housing sector could well prove deeper
 prolonged seemed likely earlier year. Participants noted investors
 become much uncertain likely future cash flows subprime
 certain nontraditional mortgages, thus valuation securities
 backed mortgages. Consequently, markets securities backed
 subprime non-traditional mortgages become illiquid, originations
 new subprime mortgages dropped sharply. markets expected
 recover time, anticipated credit standards types
 mortgages would tighter, interest rates higher relative rates conforming
 mortgages, future recent years. However, participants also observed
 mortgage loans remained readily available potential borrowers,
 interest rates conforming, conventional mortgage loans declined recent
 weeks, providing support housing sector.
 Participants thought consumer expenditures likely would expand moderate
 pace coming quarters, supported solid gains employment real income.
 Though growth consumer spending slowed second quarter, slowing
 likely reflected temporary factors part, including payback unusually
 strong growth prior quarters surge gasoline prices. Several participants
 noted risks house prices could decline significantly credit standards
 home equity loans could tightened substantially factors could weigh
 
 consumer spending. However, sizable upward revision--from negative positive-in estimates personal saving rate past three years suggested
 somewhat less need households rebuild savings.
 Participants expected business investment would supported solid
 fundamentals, including high profits, strong business balance sheets, moderate
 growth output. Recent financial market developments thought unlikely
 appreciable adverse effect capital spending. Although lenders recently
 appeared less willing extend credit financial restructuring, supply
 credit finance real investment appear significantly diminished. Funding
 become costly difficult obtain riskier corporate borrowers,
 little net change cost credit investment-grade businesses. Also,
 businesses aggregate continued sufficient internally generated funds
 finance expected level real investment. Nonetheless, participants recognized
 conditions corporate credit markets could change rapidly, adverse
 effects business spending possible. Moreover, heightened asset market
 volatility associated increase uncertainty, persist long,
 could lead businesses pare capital spending plans. Still, participants judged
 continued growth investment outlays going forward likely outcome.
 Rapid economic growth abroad decline foreign exchange value
 dollar recent quarters seen likely boost U.S. exports thus support
 economic expansion. participants also anticipated growth government
 purchases goods services would support continued growth output.
 data core inflation received intermeeting period favorable,
 meeting participants believed readings past months likely
 damped transitory factors provide reliable evidence
 recent level would sustained. Still, participants thought slight decrease
 pressures resources stability inflation expectations likely would foster
 time gradual moderation core inflation. Participants anticipated total
 inflation would slow well, particularly market expectations modest decline
 energy prices coming quarters prove correct. Participants remained
 concerned factors could augment inflation pressures, including
 continuing high level resource utilization slower trend growth productivity.

 participants noted significant increases wages Districts, particularly
 service sector, also observed overall gains labor compensation
 remained moderate, suggesting sustainable rates resource utilization could

 risks outlook sustained moderation inflation pressures remained
 tilted upside.
 discussion monetary policy intermeeting period, Committee
 members agreed maintaining existing stance policy meeting
 likely consistent overall economy expanding moderate pace

 additional downside risks economic growth. Members expected return

 time, particularly markets related subprime mortgages. However,
 deterioration financial conditions could ruled and, extent
 development could adverse effect growth prospects, might require policy
 response. Policymakers would need watch situation carefully. present,
