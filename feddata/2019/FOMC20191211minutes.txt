Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and
Communication Practices
Participants continued to discuss issues related to the
ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy
strategy, tools, and communication practices. The staff
summarized the feedback received through the Fed Listens initiative, a series of 14 public-facing events conducted around the country with a broad range of individuals and groups. These events engaged with the public directly on issues pertaining to the dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
Representatives from underserved communities who
participated in the Fed Listens events generally saw the
current strong labor market as providing significant benefits to their communities, most notably by creating
Attended the discussion of economic developments and the
outlook.

greater opportunities for individuals who have experienced difficulty finding jobs in the past. Nevertheless,
these representatives noted that the benefits from current labor market conditions flowing to people in their
communities were less than those implied by national
statistics, and they expressed concerns that the recent
gains might not be sustained in the event of an economic
downturn. Business representatives reported experiencing challenges finding qualified workers and described
several initiatives to attract and retain workers, including
training programs and a willingness to employ individuals who are unlikely to have been considered in less favorable labor market conditions. Inflation developments elicited fewer comments at these events and were
generally seen as posing less of a challenge than labor
market conditions. Representatives of retirees mentioned difficulties associated with the rising costs of
health care and prescription drugs, whereas those representing low- and middle-income communities pointed
to the rising costs of basic necessities such as housing,
utilities, and food. Business representatives emphasized
the importance of low and stable inflation for planning
and decisionmaking. Event participants were concerned
about rising costs of living and generally perceived low
inflation as desirable from that perspective. Event participants were asked about monetary policymakers’ concerns regarding overall inflation running persistently below 2 percent; they noted that the Federal Reserve could
better communicate its reasons for these concerns.
When asked about the effects of changes in interest
rates, representatives of underserved communities said
that such changes had little effect on many members of
their communities who have limited or no access to
credit. Representatives of retirees conveyed a more negative view of low interest rates, given the greater reliance
of wealthier retirees on interest income. Business representatives generally found the low interest rate environment beneficial.
The staff briefing also included an analysis of distributional considerations for monetary policy. Consistent
with the feedback received at the Fed Listens events, the
evidence reviewed by the staff showed that workers who
are young, less educated, African American, or Hispanic
tend to face a greater-than-average risk of losing their
jobs during recessions. The staff used simulations from
a specific macroeconomic model to explore how heterogeneity of households might affect the transmission of
economic shocks and changes in monetary policy to the
economy. The staff’s simulations embedded the assumption that households have limited ability to borrow,
which makes some households’ consumption spending
more sensitive to changes in income. As a result, in

these simulations, downturns lead to larger contractions
in aggregate demand than would be the case if all households could borrow to support their consumption
spending in response to a loss in income. The amplification of recessionary shocks was especially large when
the monetary policy response was constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on the policy interest rate.
Overall, the analysis suggested that the costs of recessions, as well as the benefits of economic stabilization,
might be larger than suggested by models that did not
account for differences across households regarding
their access to credit.
Participants agreed that the Fed Listens outreach efforts
had informed their understanding of the goals and
tradeoffs associated with monetary policy and had provided highly useful input into their deliberations. Several
participants voiced their desire to continue the conversations initiated at the Fed Listens events. Participants
also shared their appreciation of the feedback they receive on a regular basis from members of the public, including through the Federal Reserve System’s extensive
networks of contacts and community outreach efforts.
A few participants emphasized that policymakers’ engagement with the public helps build trust, fosters transparency, and reinforces the credibility of the Federal Reserve.
Participants generally saw the feedback from Fed Listens
events as reinforcing the importance of sustaining the
economic expansion so that the effects of a persistently
strong job market reach more of those who, in the past,
had experienced difficulty finding employment. Several
participants mentioned that sustaining strong labor market conditions helps workers build skills and cement
their attachment to the labor force in a manner that
might reduce the scarring effects of future downturns
and might increase the maximum sustainable level of
employment over the longer run. A number of participants also emphasized that sustaining strong labor market conditions is helpful for meeting the Committee’s
symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.
Some participants spoke to some of the challenges associated with assessing the maximum level of employment.
A few participants noted that aggregate statistics mask
significant heterogeneity in labor market outcomes. A
few others pointed to the continued absence of significant wage and price pressure—traditionally seen as a
symptom of a tight labor market—even as the unemployment rate had moved below most estimates of its
longer-run level. A few participants raised the possibility
that the maximum sustainable level of employment had

Page 4

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
increased as the expansion continued to draw workers
who would otherwise not be in the labor force.
Regarding inflation, participants recognized that segments of the public generally do not regard the fact that
aggregate inflation is running modestly below the Committee’s 2 percent goal as a problem. A few participants
noted that the public’s view on this issue was understandable from the perspective of households and businesses going about their daily lives in an economy with
low and stable inflation. That said, a couple of participants cautioned that inflation could emerge as a concern
among members of the public if it became more volatile
or ran at levels substantially away from the Committee’s
goal. Many participants also warned about the macroeconomic consequences of not achieving 2 percent on a
sustained basis. In particular, if inflation ran persistently
below the Committee’s objective, longer-term inflation
expectations could drift down, resulting in lower actual
inflation. With lower inflation, nominal interest rates
would be lower as well and therefore closer to the ELB.
As a result, the scope for monetary policy to support the
economy in a future downturn through interest rate cuts
would be reduced, a situation that would likely worsen
economic outcomes for households and businesses. In
light of these considerations, participants generally
agreed that they need to communicate more clearly to
the public their rationale for, and commitment to,
achieving 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis and of
ensuring that longer-run inflation expectations are anchored at levels consistent with this objective. To ensure
the effectiveness of these and other communications,
several participants stressed that the Federal Reserve
needs to adapt its communications to various audiences.
A few participants emphasized that communications
about the Committee’s resolve to return inflation to
2 percent need to be backed with actions and results to
ensure that the public sees these communications as
credible.
With respect to the role of distributional considerations
in the pursuit of the dual-mandate objectives, several
participants noted that it was important for policymakers
to be cognizant of how monetary policy affects different
segments of the population. Most participants commented on the large costs that recessions and high unemployment impose on communities, notably on their
most vulnerable constituents, and stressed the need for
monetary policy to seek to avoid recessions in the first
place or reduce their severity when they occur. A number of these participants emphasized that, while monetary policy actions can have different effects across
groups, monetary policy actions that are driven by the

pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices ultimately benefit all groups. Participants viewed the role
of monetary policy as supporting a strong, stable economy that benefits all Americans. Various participants
noted that monetary policy is a blunt instrument whose
effects cannot be targeted to specific communities. Several participants remarked that while monetary policy actions can improve the conditions of vulnerable communities, notably by supporting a strong job market, these
actions may not reduce inequality in wealth and income.
For these and other reasons, many participants emphasized that policies other than monetary policy are appropriate to directly address inequality. In addition, a couple
of participants cautioned that maintaining accommodative financial conditions could be counterproductive if
doing so fueled financial imbalances and exacerbated the
next economic downturn.
Participants agreed that their review of monetary policy
strategy, tools, and communication practices would continue at future meetings and, as a result, that the Committee would not reaffirm its existing Statement on
Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy at the
January 2020 meeting. The Committee plans to revisit
this statement closer to the conclusion of the review,
likely around the middle of 2020.
Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The System Open Market Account manager first reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Market prices appeared to respond
mainly to signs of stabilization in the U.S. and global
economies and to developments associated with trade
policy. Market participants noted some risks to the outlook including Brexit and geopolitical factors.
Regarding expectations for U.S. monetary policy, the
Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys and market-based
indicators pointed to a very high perceived likelihood of
no change in the target range for the federal funds rate
at this meeting. The expected path of the federal funds
rate implied by the medians of survey respondents’
modal forecasts remained essentially flat through 2020.
Survey- and market-implied uncertainty about the nearterm outlook for monetary policy declined, with market
commentary attributing the decrease in part to the Committee’s October communications. Survey respondents
placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target
range over 2020 than an increase.
The manager turned next to a review of money market
developments since the October meeting, starting with
an update on the implementation of the Committee’s

Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019

strategy to ensure ample reserves. Reserve management
purchases of Treasury bills continued at a pace of
$60 billion per month, with propositions remaining
strong and little discernible effect on market functioning. While these purchases accumulated, the Desk continued to conduct regular repurchase agreement (repo)
operations in order to maintain reserves at or above the
level that prevailed in early September. Repos outstanding from these Desk operations totaled roughly $215 billion per day, consisting of both overnight and term operations.
As reserve levels increased, the distribution of reserves
across bank types became comparable with where it was
in early September. The federal funds rate and other
overnight money market rates fell modestly and were
close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate for
most of the period. The intraday dispersion of rates was
also lower than when reserves were at similar levels before September. In addition to helping keep reserves
ample, repo operations likely have reduced pressures in
money markets and the dispersion in money market
rates.

stance of monetary policy. The manager also discussed
expectations to gradually transition away from active
repo operations next year as Treasury bill purchases supply a larger base of reserves. The calendar of repo operations starting in mid-January could reflect a gradual reduction in active repo operations. The manager indicated that some repos might be needed at least through
April, when tax payments will sharply reduce reserve levels.
As reserves remain ample, the manager noted that it may
become appropriate at some point to implement a technical adjustment to the IOER rate and the offered rate
on overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreements.
Should conditions warrant this adjustment, the IOER
rate could move closer to the middle of the target range
for the federal funds rate, and the ON RRP rate could
be realigned with the bottom of the target range.
The manager also noted that the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York communicated to its customers that the
remuneration rate on the foreign repo pool will be revised to be generally equivalent to the overnight reverse
repo rate. This action may reduce activity in the pool to
some extent and increase the level of reserves.

With respect to conditions around year-end, the manager noted that forward measures of market pricing continued to indicate expectations of temporary upward
pressures on some secured rates. Money market rates
are often volatile around year-end, and Federal Reserve
operations are not intended to eliminate all year-end
pressures but rather to ensure that reserve supply remains ample and to mitigate the risk that such pressures
could adversely affect the implementation of monetary
policy. The Desk had already conducted three longerterm repo operations spanning year-end—for a total of
$75 billion—and planned to announce an additional
longer-term operation, as well as increase the amount of
overnight repo offered around the year-end date. The
manager reported that the Desk is closely monitoring reserves and money market conditions and that it is prepared to adjust plans as needed.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available for the December 10–11
meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained
strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) was
increasing at a moderate rate in the second half of 2019.
Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month
percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in October. Survey-based measures of longer-run
inflation expectations were little changed.

The manager discussed two operational considerations
around policy implementation. The first involved the
risk that future Treasury bill purchases could have a
larger effect on liquidity in the Treasury bill market in
light of expected seasonal declines in bill issuance and
the Federal Reserve’s growing ownership share of outstanding bills. If this risk were to materialize, the Federal
Reserve could consider expanding the universe of securities purchased for reserve management purposes to include coupon-bearing Treasury securities with a short
time to maturity. Purchases of these short-dated securities would not affect broader financial conditions or the

Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in November, boosted in part by the return of auto workers who
had previously been on strike in October. The average
pace of job gains over the three months ending in November, which is unaffected by the strike, was stronger
than earlier in 2019. However, the rate of increase in
payrolls so far this year was slower than last year, even
accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics’ benchmark revision to payroll employment, which will be incorporated in the published data
in February 2020. The unemployment rate ticked up in
October but then moved back down to its 50-year low

of 3.5 percent in November; the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio held
steady, on balance, over those two months. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were little changed, on net, over the past
two months; the unemployment rate for each group was
below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these
rates remained. The average share of workers employed
part time for economic reasons in November stayed below its level in late 2007. Both the rate of private-sector
job openings and the rate of quits edged down in September, but these readings were still at fairly elevated levels. The four-week moving average of initial claims for
unemployment insurance benefits through late November remained near historically low levels. In general, recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be
moderate. Total labor compensation per hour in the
business sector increased 3.7 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter. The employment cost
index for private-sector workers rose 2.7 percent over
the 12 months ending in September, while average
hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent
over the 12 months ending in November.
Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price
index, increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending
in October. Core PCE price inflation (which excludes
changes in consumer food and energy prices) was
1.6 percent over that same 12-month period, while consumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation
and consumer energy prices declined. The trimmed
mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained
at 2 percent in October. The consumer price index
(CPI) rose 2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, while core CPI inflation was 2.3 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run
inflation expectations—including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey
of Professional Forecasters, the Survey of Consumer
Expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed, on balance; the Michigan survey measure ticked back down in
early December to the bottom of its recent range after
ticking up in November.
Real PCE continued to expand in October following a
strong gain in the third quarter. Sales of light motor vehicles rose markedly in November. Key factors that influence consumer spending—including the low unem-

ployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low interest rates—were supportive of solid real
PCE growth in the near term. The Michigan survey
measure of consumer sentiment rose again in early December to an upbeat level and had more than recovered
from its drop in August; the Conference Board survey
measure of consumer confidence remained at a favorable level in November.
Real residential investment appeared to be increasing
further after rising solidly in the third quarter. Both
starts and building permit issuance for single-family
homes increased in October, and starts of multifamily
units also rose. Existing home sales continued to increase in October, although new home sales edged down
following a solid gain in the third quarter. All told, the
data on construction and sales continued to suggest that
the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 has been
boosting housing activity.
Real nonresidential private fixed investment remained
weak overall after declining in the second and third quarters. Nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense
capital goods excluding aircraft increased solidly in October following a string of decreases, although many forward-looking indicators pointed to continued softness in
business equipment spending. Most measures of business sentiment were still downbeat, analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth edged down
further, and concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions. Nominal
business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector continued to decline in October, and the total number of crude oil and
natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business
spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—fell further through early December.
Industrial production decreased in October and remained notably lower than at the beginning of the year.
Production in October continued to be held down by
the strike at General Motors, although the end of the
strike and automakers’ schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would rebound in November. Overall manufacturing production appeared likely
to remain soft in coming months, reflecting generally
weak readings on new orders from national and regional
manufacturing surveys, declining domestic business investment, slow economic growth abroad, and a persistent drag from trade developments.

Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019

Total real government purchases were increasing slowly
in the fourth quarter. Nominal defense spending in October pointed to only a modest rise in real federal government purchases. Real purchases by state and local
governments looked to be moving roughly sideways;
state and local payrolls expanded modestly, on net, over
October and November, and nominal construction
spending by these governments was about flat in October.
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in
October. Exports fell a little, with declines in all export
categories except for services and industrial supplies.
Imports fell much more, and the declines were broad
based, with the largest contributions coming from imports of consumer goods and automotive products.
Available trade data suggested that the contribution of
net exports to real GDP growth, which was slightly negative in the third quarter, would turn somewhat positive
in the fourth quarter.
Foreign economic growth slowed further in the third
quarter amid continued weakness in the global manufacturing sector. Recent monthly indicators pointed to a
stabilization in the pace of economic growth in China
and several advanced foreign economies. However,
other indicators suggested that social unrest weighed
heavily on economic activity in several countries, most
notably in Hong Kong, and that weakness persisted in
parts of Latin America. Foreign inflation picked up
somewhat as energy prices stabilized, although inflation
remained relatively low in most foreign economies.
Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Investor sentiment fluctuated over the intermeeting period largely in response to ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China. On net, equity prices
increased moderately while corporate bond spreads narrowed slightly. Yields on nominal Treasury securities
were little changed. Financing conditions for businesses
and households remained supportive of spending and
economic activity.
Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting
period were viewed as suggesting that additional nearterm changes to the target range for the federal funds
rate were less likely than had previously been expected.
A straight read of the probability distribution for the federal funds rate implied by options prices suggested that
investors assigned a high probability to the target range
remaining unchanged at the December FOMC meeting.
Forward rates implied by overnight index swap quotes
declined slightly, on net, and implied about a 25 basis
point decline in the federal funds rate by the end of 2020.

Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated over the intermeeting period but, on net, the Treasury curve was little
changed. Measures of inflation compensation over the
next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities increased slightly from
near multiyear low levels.
Broad stock price indexes increased moderately over the
intermeeting period amid movements largely attributed
to trade-related developments and stronger-thanexpected U.S. employment reports. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index increased modestly but remained near the low end of its historical distribution.
On net, corporate credit spreads narrowed slightly.
Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable
over the intermeeting period. Interest rates for overnight secured and unsecured loans fell in line with the
25 basis point decrease in the target range for the federal
funds rate at the October FOMC meeting. Trading in
money markets was orderly, with volumes in normal
ranges and spreads narrower relative to the IOER rate.
Pressures on rates at October month-end and November mid-month—both days with sizable settlements of
Treasury auctions—were muted compared with other
recent Treasury issuance days. The Desk’s open market
operations aimed at maintaining ample reserves proceeded smoothly.
As in U.S. markets, sentiment in foreign financial markets fluctuated in response to news on U.S.–China trade
negotiations. Most foreign equity price indexes and
long-term sovereign yields in Germany, the United
Kingdom, and Japan increased modestly on net. The
broad dollar index ended the period little changed. Political unrest in Hong Kong and Latin America garnered
some financial market attention and led to a weakening
of some Latin American currencies, notably the Chilean
peso, but the imprint on broader financial markets was
limited.
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained accommodative. Gross issuance of corporate
bonds was robust, on average, in October and November. Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans remained near recent monthly averages. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial loans held by banks contracted in
October but increased modestly in November. The
credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated
slightly in recent months but remained solid overall. After particularly strong gross equity issuance in September, initial public offerings declined and seasoned offerings remained solid in October and November. Credit

stayed accommodative.

2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its
longer-run natural rate.

In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing
conditions also remained generally accommodative.
Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)
spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period
but remained near the low end of their post-crisis range.
Agency and non-agency CMBS issuance increased in
October to a post-crisis high. CRE loan growth at banks
also increased in October relative to recent quarters.

The staff’s forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2019
was revised down a bit, as a downward revision to core
PCE prices in response to recent data was partly offset
by an upward revision to consumer energy prices. Beyond 2019, core inflation was expected to be above its
pace this year, and this projection was revised up a touch
because of the slightly tighter resource utilization in the
current forecast. The projection for total inflation in
2020 was a little lower than for core inflation due to a
projected decline in consumer energy prices. Over the
remainder of the medium-term projection, total inflation
was expected to be about the same as core inflation, although both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run a bit below 2 percent through 2022.

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market
remained accommodative over the intermeeting period.
Mortgage rates were little changed since the October
FOMC meeting. Consistent with this year’s decline in
mortgage rates, home-purchase originations and refinancing originations both rose. Mortgage credit standards were little changed.
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally supportive of growth in consumer
spending, although conditions continued to be tight for
nonprime borrowers. Auto loans increased, consistent
with significant declines in auto loan interest rates this
year. Credit card debt grew at a solid pace, and interest
rates on credit card debt began to fall. Consumer
asset-backed securities issuance was strong through October as spreads stabilized at levels that were somewhat
above their post-crisis averages.
Staff Economic Outlook
The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by
the staff for the December FOMC meeting was revised
up a little for the second half of 2019 relative to the previous projection. This revision primarily reflected incoming data for household spending and business investment that were somewhat stronger than expected.
Even with this upward revision, real GDP was forecast
to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in
the first half, mostly because of continued soft business
investment and slower increases in government spending. The forecast for real GDP growth over the medium
term was also revised up a bit, on balance, primarily in
response to a somewhat higher projected path for equity
prices. Nevertheless, real GDP growth was still expected to slow modestly in the coming years, largely because of a fading boost from fiscal policy. Output was
forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021
and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output
growth in 2022. The unemployment rate was projected
to be roughly flat at around its current level through

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its
projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment
rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of
the past 20 years. The staff viewed the downside risks
to economic activity as having eased a bit since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside,
with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate. Important factors influencing this assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign
economic developments seemed more likely to move in
directions that could have significant negative effects on
the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than
assumed. In addition, softness in business investment
and manufacturing production so far this year were seen
as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected. The
risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside
risks to the forecast for economic activity.
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the
Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate,
and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and
over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.
The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable
would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further
shocks to the economy. These projections are described

Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019

in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which
is an addendum to these minutes.
Participants agreed that the labor market had remained
strong over the intermeeting period and that economic
activity had risen at a moderate rate. Job gains had been
solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Although household
spending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports had remained weak. On a
12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items
other than food and energy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation
remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
Participants generally expected sustained expansion of
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. This outlook reflected, at least in part, the support provided by the current stance of monetary policy. Nevertheless, global developments, related to both persistent uncertainty regarding international trade and weakness in economic
growth abroad, continued to pose some risks to the outlook, and inflation pressures remained muted.
In their discussion of the household sector, participants
agreed that spending had increased at a strong pace.
They generally expected that consumption spending
would likely remain on a firm footing, supported by
strong labor market conditions, rising incomes, and solid
consumer confidence. In addition, residential investment had continued to pick up, reflecting, in part, the
effects of lower mortgage rates. Many participants commented that business contacts in consumer-related industries reported strong demand or that contacts were
optimistic about the holiday retail spending season.
However, some participants observed that recent data
on retail sales or motor vehicle spending had decelerated
slightly.
With respect to the business sector, participants saw
trade developments and concerns about the global economic growth outlook as the main factors contributing
to weak business investment and exports. Participants
generally expected these factors to continue to damp
business investment and exports. They expressed similar concerns about activity in manufacturing industries.
A few participants noted that the current weakness in
capital expenditures could lead to a slower pace of
productivity growth in future years. A few others observed that businesses were diversifying their supply
chains or investing in technology to adapt to persistent

uncertainty regarding international trade, which might
mitigate the effects of such uncertainty on future business spending.
A number of participants commented on challenges facing the energy and agriculture sectors. A few participants remarked that activity in the energy sector was especially weak, reflecting low petroleum prices, low profitability, and tight financing conditions for energyproducing firms. Several participants noted that the agricultural sector also faced a number of difficulties, including those associated with trade developments, weak
export demand, and challenging financial positions for
many farmers. A couple of participants noted that farm
subsidies from the federal government were offsetting a
portion of the financial strain on farmers.
Participants judged that conditions in the labor market
remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a
50-year low, job gains remaining solid, and some
measures of labor force participation increasing further.
The unemployment rate was likely to remain low going
forward, and various participants remarked that there
were some indications that further strengthening in
overall labor market conditions was possible without
creating undesirable pressures on resources. In particular, a number of participants noted that the labor force
participation rate could rise further still. Moreover,
measures of wage growth had generally remained moderate. However, a few participants commented that increases in the labor force would likely moderate as slack
in the labor market diminished. In addition, a couple of
participants remarked that the preliminary benchmark
revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains
would likely show less momentum coming into this year
once those revisions are incorporated in published data
early next year. A couple of other participants thought
it was important to better understand the quality of jobs
being created. Business contacts in many Districts indicated continued strong labor demand, with firms reporting difficulties in finding qualified workers or broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized
groups. A number of participants noted that wage pressures were evident for some industries in their Districts,
and a couple of participants commented that firms were
responding to those pressures in a variety of ways, including investing in technology that could serve as a substitute for labor.
In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that recent readings on overall and core
PCE inflation, measured on a 12-month change basis,
had continued to run below 2 percent. Survey-based

Page 10

measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, and market-based measures of inflation
compensation remained low. A few participants commented on factors that may temporarily exert upward
pressure on some measures of inflation in the coming
months. Assessing all these factors, participants generally expected that inflation would return to the 2 percent
objective as the economic expansion continued and resource utilization remained high. However, weakness
abroad and subdued global inflation pressures were cited
as sources of risk to this assessment. Participants who
expressed less confidence that inflation would return
promptly to the 2 percent objective commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past
several years even as resource utilization had increased
or that global or technology-related factors were exerting
downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult
to overcome.

A number of participants agreed that maintaining the
current stance of monetary policy would give the Committee some time to assess the full effects on the economy of its policy decisions and communications over the
course of this year along with other information bearing
on the economic outlook. Participants also discussed
how maintaining the current stance of policy for a time
could be helpful for cushioning the economy from the
global developments that have been weighing on economic activity and for returning inflation to the Committee’s symmetric objective of 2 percent. Participants
generally expressed concerns regarding inflation continuing to fall short of 2 percent. Although a number of
participants noted that some of the factors currently
holding down inflation were likely to prove transitory,
various participants were concerned that indicators were
suggesting that the level of longer-term inflation expectations was too low.

Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook
for economic activity. While many saw the risks as tilted
somewhat to the downside, some risks were seen to have
eased over recent months. In particular, there were
some tentative signs that trade tensions with China were
easing, and the probability of a no-deal Brexit was judged
to have lessened further. In addition, there were indications that the prospects for global economic growth may
be stabilizing. A number of participants observed that
the domestic economy was showing resilience in the face
of headwinds from global developments. Moreover, statistical models designed to gauge the probability of recession using financial market data, including those
based on information from the Treasury yield curve,
suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring
over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent
months. However, new uncertainties had emerged regarding trade policy with Argentina, Brazil, and France,
and political tensions in Hong Kong persisted.

A few participants raised the concern that keeping interest rates low over a long period might encourage excessive risk-taking, which could exacerbate imbalances in
the financial sector. These participants offered various
perspectives on the relationship between financial stability and policies that keep interest rates persistently low.
They remarked that such policies could be inconsistent
with sustaining maximum employment, could make the
next recession more severe than otherwise, or could
strengthen the case for the active use of macroprudential
tools to guard against emerging imbalances.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting,
participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to
1¾ percent to support sustained expansion of economic
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. As
reflected in their SEP projections, participants regarded
the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain
appropriate for a time as long as incoming information
about the economy remained broadly consistent with the
economic outlook. Of course, if developments emerged
that led to a material reassessment of the outlook, the
stance of policy would need to adjust in a way that fostered the Committee’s dual-mandate objectives.

Various participants remarked on issues related to the
implementation of monetary policy, highlighting topics
for further discussion at future meetings. Among the
topics mentioned were the potential role of a standing
repo facility in an ample-reserves regime, the setting of
administered rates, and the composition of the Federal
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities over the longer
run.
Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting,
members noted that information received since the
FOMC met in October indicated that the labor market
remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had
remained low. Although household spending had been
rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remained weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent. Market-based
measures of inflation compensation remained low;

Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019
Page 11
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
Members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. Members judged
that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate
to support sustained expansion of economic activity,
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.
Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and
size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and
expected economic conditions relative to its maximum
employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. And they concurred that this assessment
would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and
readings on financial and international developments.
With regard to the postmeeting statement, members
agreed to state that they judged that “the current stance
of monetary policy is appropriate” to support the
achievement of the Committee’s policy objectives.
Members discussed their options regarding references to
global developments and muted inflation pressures in
the statement. In their judgment, these factors, cited in
previous postmeeting statements as part of the rationale
for adjusting the stance of policy, remained salient features of the outlook. Accordingly, they agreed to cite
them in the sentence indicating that “the Committee will
continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.” With the retention
of these references to global developments and muted
inflation pressures, members agreed that the text on uncertainties about the outlook could be removed. A few
members suggested that the language stating that monetary policy would support inflation “near” 2 percent
could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers
were comfortable with inflation running below that
level; they preferred language that referred to returning
inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Other members thought that the reference to
“near” 2 percent was intended to encompass modest deviations of inflation above and below 2 percent.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at
2:00 p.m.:

“Effective December 12, 2019, the Federal
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to
undertake open market operations as necessary
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target
range of 1½ to 1¾ percent. In light of recent
and expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s
non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs
the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills
at least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or
above the level that prevailed in early September
2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to
continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through
January 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of
sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to
mitigate the risk of money market pressures that
could adversely affect policy implementation.
In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to
conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with
maturities of more than one day when necessary
to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar
trading conventions) at an offering rate of
1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the
value of Treasury securities held outright in the
System Open Market Account that are available
for such operations and by a per-counterparty
limit of $30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue
rolling over at auction all principal payments
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury
securities and to continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities received during each calendar
month. Principal payments from agency debt
and agency mortgage-backed securities up to
$20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match
the maturity composition of Treasury securities
outstanding; principal payments in excess of
$20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.
Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal

Page 12

Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities
transactions.”
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
“Information received since the Federal Open
Market Committee met in October indicates
that the labor market remains strong and that
economic activity has been rising at a moderate
rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in
recent months, and the unemployment rate has
remained low. Although household spending
has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed
investment and exports remain weak. On a
12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation
for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures
of inflation compensation remain low; surveybased measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment
and price stability. The Committee decided to
maintain the target range for the federal funds
rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. The Committee
judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market
conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s
symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee
will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook,
including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate
path of the target range for the federal funds
rate.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized
and expected economic conditions relative to its
maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of

information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures
and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.”
Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C.
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James
Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L.
George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric S. Rosengren.
Voting against this action: None.
Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1.55 percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 2.25 percent, effective December 12,
2019.
Organizational Matters
By unanimous vote, Lorie K. Logan was selected to
serve at the pleasure of the Committee as manager, System Open Market Account, on the understanding that
her selection was subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Secretary’s note: Advice subsequently was received that the selection of Ms. Logan as manager was satisfactory to the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York.
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 28–29,
2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on December 11, 2019.
Notation Vote
By notation vote completed on November 19, 2019, the
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the
Committee meeting held on October 29–30, 2019.

Summary of Economic Projections
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on December 10–11, 2019,
meeting participants submitted their projections of the
most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product
(GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for
each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run.
Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with
his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—
including a path for the federal funds rate and its longerrun value—and assumptions about other factors likely
to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the
value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and
in the absence of further shocks to the economy. 1 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path
of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that
best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the
statutory mandate to promote maximum employment
and price stability.
Almost all participants expected that, under appropriate
monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2020 would run
at or slightly above 1.9 percent, the median of current
estimates of its longer-run rate. The median of the projections for the growth rate of real GDP edges down
each year over the projection horizon and, for 2022, is
modestly below the median of the current estimates of
its longer-run rate. The median of the current projections for the unemployment rate was lower than that in
the September Summary of Economic Projections
(SEP) for each year of the projection period, and some
participants reduced their estimates of the longer-run
normal rate of unemployment, resulting in a slight decline in the median estimate. The medians of the projections for both total and core inflation, as measured by
the four-quarter percent change in the price index for
personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increase significantly from 2019 to 2020 and more modestly in 2021
to reach 2 percent that year. Almost all participants expected that inflation would be at or slightly above the
Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2021 and 2022. A
couple more participants, relative to the September SEP,
projected inflation to exceed 2 percent at some point
1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds
rate.

during the projection period. The medians of the projections for both total and core inflation were unchanged
for 2020 through 2022, compared with the September
SEP. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics
for the projections.
As shown in figure 2, a substantial majority of participants indicated that their expectations regarding the evolution of the economy, relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds at its
current level through the end of 2020. Compared with
the September SEP submissions, the median projection
for the federal funds rate was 25 basis points lower in
each year over the projection period and retained its
modest upward tilt in 2021 and 2022. The median of
participants’ assessments of the appropriate level for the
federal funds rate in 2022 was slightly below the median
of estimates of its longer-run level; the median estimate
of the longer-run level was unchanged from its value in
the September SEP.
Most participants regarded the uncertainties around
their projections as broadly similar to the average over
the past 20 years. The majority of participants continued
to assess the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth
as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment
rate as weighted to the upside. However, compared with
the September submissions, several participants shifted
their assessments of the balance of risks around these
projections to being broadly balanced. Most participants
judged the risks to their inflation outlook as broadly balanced, though one-third of participants viewed the risks
to their inflation projections as weighted to the downside; no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside. The uncertainties and risks around participants’ projections for headline and core inflation were little changed from the September SEP.
The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemployment
As shown in table 1, the medians of participants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020, conditional
on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary
policy, were 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively, a
touch above the median estimate of the longer-run

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are percent changes from the fourth
quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively,
the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate
are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of
appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge
under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint
of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified
calendar year or over the longer run. The September projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on
September 17-18, 2019. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in
conjunction with the September 17-18, 2019, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the December 10-11, 2019,
meeting.
1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even,
the median is the average of the two middle projections.

growth rate of 1.9 percent. The median of the projections for the growth rate of real GDP declines slowly
over the projection horizon and, in 2022, is modestly below the median of the current estimates of its longer-run
rate. The medians of the projections for real GDP
growth in all four years of the projection period, as well
as in the longer run, were unchanged from the September SEP.
A majority of participants marked down their projections of the unemployment rate in each year of the projection period, and some participants lowered their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.
As a result, the medians of the projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 through
2022 were 3.5 percent, 3.6 percent, and 3.7 percent, respectively, each 0.2 percentage point lower than in the
September projections. The median estimate of the
longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.1 percent, 0.1 percentage point lower than in September.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate, respectively, from 2019 to 2022 and in
the longer run. The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2020 tilted slightly higher,
as many participants upgraded their projections a bit relative to those in the September SEP, although the median projection was unchanged. The distributions of individual projections of real GDP growth in 2021 and
2022 and in the longer run were little changed overall.
The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run
shifted lower relative to those in September.
The Outlook for Inflation
As shown in table 1, the median projection for core PCE
price inflation was 1.6 percent for 2019, a modest decrease from the September projections. The medians of
the projections for both total and core PCE price inflation were each 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2.0 percent in
both 2021 and 2022—all unchanged from September.
Figures 3.C and 3.D show the distributions of participants’ views about their outlooks for inflation. Although the medians of the projections for total and core
PCE price inflation from 2020 through 2022 were unchanged from the September SEP, a couple more participants projected inflation to be slightly above the
Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2022.
Appropriate Monetary Policy
Figure 3.E shows the distributions of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of
the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of

each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run. A
substantial majority of participants projected a federal
funds rate of 1.63 percent for the end of 2020. Four
participants assessed that the most likely appropriate rate
at year-end for 2020 would be 1.88 percent. For subsequent years, the medians of the projections were
1.88 percent at the end of 2021 and 2.13 percent at the
end of 2022. The distribution of participants’ estimates
of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was little
changed, and the median estimate was unchanged from
September at 2.50 percent.
Compared with the projections prepared for the September SEP, a number of participants marked down
their assessments of the appropriate level of the federal
funds rate at the end of 2020, reflecting in part the reduction in the target range at the October meeting and
causing both the range and central tendency of projections for 2020 to narrow considerably. Some participants lowered their projections for the appropriate level
in 2021 and 2022. The median projection for the federal
funds rate was 25 basis points lower in each year in the
projection period. Realized inflation running persistently below target and risks associated with trade policy
and foreign economic growth were cited as key factors
informing participants’ judgments about the appropriate
path for the federal funds rate.
Uncertainty and Risks
In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds
rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of
possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those
outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should
they occur. As a reference, table 2 provides measures of
forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of
various private and government forecasts over the past
20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment
rate, and total PCE price inflation. Those measures are
represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the
top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts
display the SEP medians for the three variables surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived
from the forecast errors reported in table 2. If the degree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar
to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the
risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then
future outcomes of these variables would have about a
70 percent probability of being within these confidence
intervals. For all three variables, this measure of uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.

NOTE: Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the
root mean squared error of projections for 1999 through 2018 that
were released in the winter by various private and government forecasters. As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain
assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal
funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection
errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic
Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s
Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020
(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.
1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1.
2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure
that has been most widely used in government and private economic
forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to
fourth quarter basis.
3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds
rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury
bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent,
in the fourth quarter.

Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding their individual economic projections are
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and
4.C. A substantial majority of participants viewed the
uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic variables as being broadly similar to the average over the
past 20 years.
Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric
around the median projections, they do not reflect any
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may
see in their economic projections. Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their current economic
projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Relative to the September SEP,
more participants saw the risks to the outlook for real
GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, although a small majority continued to view the

risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted
to the downside and for the unemployment rate as
weighted to the upside. Most participants continued to
judge the risks to their inflation outlook as broadly balanced, while some participants viewed the risks to their
inflation outlook as weighted to the downside. No participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook
as weighted to the upside.
In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their
economic projections, some participants mentioned
trade developments and concerns about foreign economic growth as sources of uncertainty or downside risk
to the U.S. economic growth outlook. In contrast, the
underlying strength of both consumer spending and the
labor market was cited as balancing the risks around the
growth outlook. In addition, most of the participants
who shifted their balance of risks for output growth to
“broadly balanced” cited more accommodative monetary policy as a contributing factor. For the inflation outlook, the possibility that inflation expectations could be
drifting below levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective was viewed as a downside risk.
A couple of participants mentioned higher tariffs as a
source of upside risk to their inflation outlook.
Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable
uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the federal
funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments over time in key economic variables—such as
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation—uncertainty surrounding the projected path for
the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables, along
with other factors. Figure 5 provides a graphic representation of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for
the federal funds rate surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the results presented in table 2. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast
uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and increases for longer horizons.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth
quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric
and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years;
more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that
prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the
basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and
risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking,
participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20
years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their
assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections
as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For
definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively,

assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the
lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar”
to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan
chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants
who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their
projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box
“Forecast Uncertainty.”

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
Committee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of
the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to onset the effects of shocks to the economy.
The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.
* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty
The economic projections provided by the members of
the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis
for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these
projections, however. The economic and statistical models
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad
unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP)
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of,
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the
past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand
within a range of 2.2 to 3.8 percent in the current year, 1.4 to
4.6 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the
third and fourth years. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the second year,
1.0 to 3.0 percent in the third year, and 1.1 to 2.9 percent in
the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may
not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular
projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be
asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.
Because current conditions may differ from those that
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is,
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather
than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable
uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that
point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges
for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections
of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted,
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of
shocks to the economy.
If at some point in the future the confidence interval
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the
Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention;
it would not have any implications for possible future policy
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so
were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset
purchases, to provide additional accommodation.
While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1
provides information on the range of views across FOMC
participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast
errors over the past 20 years.
