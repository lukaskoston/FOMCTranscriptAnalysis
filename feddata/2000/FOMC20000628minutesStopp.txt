 production employment rising somewhat reduced rates. Core consumer
 prices continued evidence acceleration, important extent reflecting
 indirect effects sharp increase oil prices past year.
 Nonfarm payroll employment increased May, although rise

 Industrial production continued rise May brisk increase April,

 Higher mortgage rates apparently exerting restraining effect residential
 housing activity. Total private housing starts fell May lowest level since

 factors included gradually waning wealth effects associated absence

 Strengthening economic activity many nations important U.S.
 trading partners reflected expanding exports, several members provided
 anecdotal confirmation growing foreign markets many U.S. goods services.

 many domestic businesses, would add overall demand pressures U.S.
 producer resources time latter already operating high
 levels.
 regard outlook inflation, members gave considerable attention
 somewhat faster increases broad price measures past year,
 differed extent regarding prospects increases inflation.
 generally agreed developments relating energy would continue exert
 upward pressure prices near term, including passthrough indirect
 effects higher oil prices core measures inflation. Looking beyond near
 term, number members, noting core measures consumer prices
 rising rapidly year, concerned prices might well continue
 accelerate gradually, even assuming economic expansion would sustained
 pace close economy's potential. view, labor markets already
 operating levels utilization likely eventually produce rising labor
 costs would passed market prices even productivity growth
 remained high rose somewhat further. members optimistic
 core inflation might contained near current levels. recent increase core
 inflation could largely reflect indirect effects rise energy prices. date,
 unit labor costs quite subdued, leaving open question

 restrain unit labor costs degree, product markets remained highly
 competitive. However, even members saw considerable inflation risks

 agreed foreseeable future possible increases underlying inflation
 remained principal risk continued good performance U.S. economy.

 retarding effects spending, key factors decision. uncertainties
 surrounding outlook economy, notably extent duration
 recent moderation spending effects appreciable tightening
 past year, including ½ percentage point increase intended federal funds
 rate May meeting, reinforced argument leaving stance policy
 unchanged meeting weighting incoming data carefully. Several members
 commented considerable amount new information bearing
 prospective strength economy outlook inflation would become
 available relatively long interval next meeting August.
 Members generally saw little risk deferring policy tightening move,
 particularly since possibility underlying inflation would worsen appreciably
 seemed remote prevailing circumstances. Among factors, inflation
 expectations remarkably stable despite rising energy prices, real
 interest rates already relatively elevated.
 discussion balance-of-risks sentence press statement issued

 express, every meeting earlier year, belief risks
 remained weighted toward rising inflation. Indications growth aggregate
 demand moderating pace closer potential supply still partial
 tentative, labor markets remained unusually tight. Many Committee
 members noted that, based currently available information, additional firming
 policy could well needed point future, though number also
 expressed opinion less tightening probably would required

 tightening moves unlikely prospect.
