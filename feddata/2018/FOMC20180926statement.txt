Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates
that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a
strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment
rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly.
On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy
remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on
balance.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the
target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent
objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.
In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee
decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its
maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This
assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor
market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on
financial and international developments.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H. Powell, Chairman;
John C. Williams, Vice Chairman; Thomas I. Barkin; Raphael W. Bostic; Lael Brainard;
Richard H. Clarida; Esther L. George; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K. Quarles.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
announced by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its statement on September 26,
2018:
•

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 2.20 percent, effective
September 27, 2018.

•

As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and
direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed
otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance
with the following domestic policy directive:
“Effective September 27, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the
Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal
funds rate in a target range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent, including overnight reverse
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more
than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar
trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only
by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market
Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of
$30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of
principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities
maturing during September that exceeds $24 billion, and to continue reinvesting
in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the
Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed
securities received during September that exceeds $16 billion. Effective in
October, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction the amount of
principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities
maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to reinvest in
agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the
Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed
securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small
deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap
transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency
mortgage-backed securities transactions.”
