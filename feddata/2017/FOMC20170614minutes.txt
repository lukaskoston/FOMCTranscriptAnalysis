Wright to serve as Associate Economist, effective

first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in
2018.
Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager of the System Open Market Account
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets over the period since the May
FOMC meeting. Yields on Treasury securities and the
foreign exchange value of the dollar had declined modestly, while equity prices had continued to rise, contributing to a further easing of financial conditions according to some measures. Moreover, realized and implied
volatility in financial markets remained low. Meanwhile,
inflation compensation edged lower. Survey results and
market pricing suggested that market participants saw a
high probability of an increase in the FOMC’s target
range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.
The deputy manager reviewed survey results on market
expectations for SOMA reinvestment policy and for the
evolution of the System’s balance sheet over coming
years. The deputy manager also commented on money
market developments. Over the intermeeting period,
the federal funds rate remained well within the FOMC’s
target range, and take-up at the System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility was little changed
from the previous period. The spread between the
three-month London interbank offered rate and the
overnight index swap (OIS) rate had narrowed markedly
in recent months after rising noticeably in advance of the
implementation of money market fund reform in the fall
of 2016. The deputy manager also summarized details
of the operational approach that the Open Market Desk

Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2017
Page 3
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

planned to follow if the Committee adopted the proposal for SOMA reinvestment policy to be considered at
this meeting.
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.
There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period.
System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy
The Chair observed that, starting with the March 2017
FOMC meeting, Committee participants had been discussing approaches to reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner.
She noted that participants appeared to have reached a
consensus on an approach that involved specifying caps
on the monthly amount of principal payments from securities holdings that would not be reinvested; these caps
would rise over the period of a year, after which they
would remain constant. Given this consensus, the Chair
proposed that participants approve the plan and that it
be published as an addendum to the Committee’s Policy
Normalization Principles and Plans; the addendum
would be released at the conclusion of this meeting so as
to inform the public well in advance of implementing the
reinvestment policy. It was anticipated that when the
Committee determined that economic conditions warranted implementation of the program, that step would
be communicated through the Committee’s postmeeting
statement. Participants unanimously supported the proposal.
POLICY NORMALIZATION PRINCIPLES AND
PLANS
(Addendum adopted June 13, 2017)
All participants agreed to augment the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing the
following additional details regarding the approach the
FOMC intends to use to reduce the Federal Reserve’s
holdings of Treasury and agency securities once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under
way.1
•
The Committee intends to gradually reduce the
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings by decreasing its
reinvestment of the principal payments it receives
from securities held in the System Open Market Account. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested
only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising
caps.
○ For payments of principal that the Federal Reserve receives from maturing Treasury securities,

the Committee anticipates that the cap will be $6 billion per month initially and will increase in steps of
$6 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months
until it reaches $30 billion per month.
○ For payments of principal that the Federal Reserve receives from its holdings of agency debt and
mortgage-backed securities, the Committee anticipates that the cap will be $4 billion per month initially and will increase in steps of $4 billion at threemonth intervals over 12 months until it reaches
$20 billion per month.
○ The Committee also anticipates that the caps
will remain in place once they reach their respective
maximums so that the Federal Reserve’s securities
holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and
predictable manner until the Committee judges that
the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities
than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
•
Gradually reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings will result in a declining supply of reserve
balances. The Committee currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a
level appreciably below that seen in recent years but
larger than before the financial crisis; the level will reflect the banking system’s demand for reserve balances
and the Committee’s decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively
in the future. The Committee expects to learn more
about the underlying demand for reserves during the
process of balance sheet normalization.
•
The Committee affirms that changing the target
range for the federal funds rate is its primary means of
adjusting the stance of monetary policy. However, the
Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestment of principal payments received on securities held
by the Federal Reserve if a material deterioration in the
economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction
in the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate.
Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use
its full range of tools, including altering the size and
composition of its balance sheet, if future economic
conditions were to warrant a more accommodative
monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the June 13–14 meeting
showed that labor market conditions continued to
strengthen in recent months and suggested that real
gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding at a faster
pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter. The
12-month change in overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), slowed a bit further in April; total
consumer price inflation and core inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, were both running somewhat below 2 percent. Survey-based measures
of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed
on balance.
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in
April and May, and the average pace of job gains over
the first five months of the year was solid. The unemployment rate moved down to 4.3 percent in May; the
unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics stepped down but remained above the unemployment rates for Asians and for whites. The overall labor
force participation rate declined somewhat, and the
share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased a little. The rate of private-sector job
openings increased in March and April, while the quits
rate was little changed and the hiring rate moved down.
The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low
level through early June. Measures of labor compensation continued to rise at moderate rates. Compensation
per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased
2¼ percent over the four quarters ending in the first
quarter, a bit slower than over the same period a year
earlier. Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in May,
about the same as over the comparable period a year earlier.
Total industrial production rose considerably in April,
reflecting gains in manufacturing, mining, and utilities
output. Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that
motor vehicle production would slow in subsequent
months, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national
and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to modest
gains in factory output over the near term.

Real PCE rose solidly in April after increasing only modestly in the first quarter. Light motor vehicle sales picked
up in April but then moved down somewhat in May.
The components of the nominal retail sales data used by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE were flat in May, but estimated increases in
these components of sales for the previous two months
were revised up. In addition, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending pointed to further solid growth in total real PCE in the near term, including continued gains in employment, real disposable
personal income, and households’ net worth. Moreover,
consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained upbeat in
May.
Residential investment appeared to be slowing after increasing briskly in the first quarter. The first-quarter
strength may have reflected housing activity shifting earlier in response to unseasonably warm weather last quarter, to an anticipation of higher future interest rates, or
to both. Starts of new single-family homes edged up in
April, but the issuance of building permits for these
homes declined somewhat. Meanwhile, starts of multifamily units fell. Moreover, sales of both new and existing homes decreased in April.
Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property seemed to be increasing further after
rising at a solid pace in the first quarter. Both nominal
shipments and new orders of nondefense capital goods
excluding aircraft rose in April, and new orders continued to exceed shipments, pointing to further gains in
shipments in the near term. In addition, indicators of
business sentiment were upbeat in recent months. Although firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential
structures excluding drilling and mining declined in
April, the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, continued to rise through early June.
Nominal federal government spending data for April
and May pointed to essentially flat real federal purchases
in the second quarter. Real state and local government
purchases appeared to be moving down, as state and local government payrolls declined, on net, in April and
May, and nominal construction expenditures by these
governments decreased in April.
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened
slightly in March, with a small decline in exports and a
small increase in imports. The March data, together with
revised estimates for earlier months, indicated that real
exports grew briskly in the first quarter and at a faster

Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2017
Page 5
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

pace than in the second half of 2016. Real imports also
increased in the first quarter but at a slower pace than in
the second half of 2016. In April, the nominal trade deficit widened, as imports picked up while exports declined slightly. Net exports were estimated to have made
a small positive contribution to real GDP growth in the
first quarter. However, the April trade data suggested
that net exports might be a slight drag on real GDP
growth in the second quarter.
Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE
price index, increased 1¾ percent over the 12 months
ending in April. Core PCE price inflation was 1½ percent over those same 12 months. Over the 12 months
ending in May, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a
little less than 2 percent, while core CPI inflation was
1¾ percent. The median of inflation expectations over
the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey was unchanged in May, and the median expectation for PCE
price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of
Professional Forecasters also held steady in the second
quarter. Likewise, the medians of longer-run inflation
expectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers
and Survey of Market Participants were essentially unchanged in June.
The economic expansions in Canada and the euro area
as well as in China and many other emerging market
economies (EMEs) continued to firm in the first quarter.
In contrast, economic growth in the United Kingdom
slowed sharply. Recent indicators suggested that real
GDP growth in most foreign economies remained solid
in the second quarter. Headline inflation across the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) generally appeared to
moderate from the pace registered over the first quarter,
as the effects of earlier increases in energy prices started
to fade; core inflation continued to be subdued in many
AFEs. Among the EMEs, inflation in China rose while
inflation in Latin America fell. In Mexico, the effects of
fuel price hikes in January and the pass-through from
earlier currency depreciation to prices started to wane,
but inflation remained above the central bank’s target.
Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Domestic financial market conditions remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period. U.S.
equity prices increased over the period, longer-term
Treasury yields declined, and the dollar depreciated. A
decline in the perceived likelihood of a significant fiscal
expansion and the below-expectations reading on the
April CPI reportedly contributed to lower yields on
longer-tenor Treasury securities. Market participants’
perceptions of an improved global economic outlook

appeared to provide some support to prices of risk assets.
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period
were viewed as broadly in line with investors’ expectations that the Committee would continue to remove policy accommodation at a gradual pace. Market participants interpreted the May FOMC statement and the
meeting minutes as indicating that the Committee had
not materially changed its economic outlook. In response to the discussion of SOMA reinvestment policy
in the minutes, a number of market participants reportedly pulled forward their expectations for the most likely
timing of a change to the Committee’s reinvestment policy, a shift that was evident in the responses to the
Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market
Participants. However, investors also reportedly viewed
the Committee’s planning as mitigating the risk that the
process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would lead to outsized movements in interest
rates or have adverse effects on market functioning.
The probability of an increase in the target range for the
federal funds rate occurring at the June meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, rose
to a high level. However, the expected federal funds rate
from late 2018 to the end of 2020 implied by OIS quotes
declined slightly. Immediately following the May
FOMC meeting, nominal Treasury yields rose at short
and intermediate maturities, reportedly reflecting the response of investors to a passage in the postmeeting
statement indicating the Committee’s view that the slowing in real GDP growth during the first quarter was likely
to be transitory. Later in the intermeeting period, yields
declined in reaction to the release of weaker-thanexpected April CPI data and the somewhat disappointing May employment report. On balance, the Treasury
yield curve flattened, with short-term yields rising modestly and the 10-year yield declining. Both 5-year and
5-to-10-year-forward TIPS-based inflation compensation declined, in part reflecting the below-expectations
inflation data.
Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased. One-monthahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—
the VIX—was little changed, on net, and remained near
the lower end of its historical range.
Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable
over the intermeeting period. Yields on a broad set of
money market instruments remained in the ranges observed since the FOMC increased the target range for
the federal funds rate in March. Term OIS rates rose as

Page 6

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

expectations firmed for an increase in the federal funds
rate target at this meeting.
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses continued to be accommodative. Commercial and industrial
loans outstanding increased in April and May after being
weak in the first quarter, although the growth of these
loans remained well below the pace seen a year ago. Issuance of both corporate debt and equity was strong.
Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans was solid
in April and May, although it receded from the near-record levels seen over the previous two months.
Commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks’ books
grew robustly in April and May, with nonfarm nonresidential loans leading the expansion. However, recent
CRE loan growth was a bit slower than that during the
first quarter, in part reflecting a slowdown in lending for
both construction and multifamily units. Issuance of
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)
through the first five months of this year was similar to
the issuance over the same period a year earlier. While
delinquency rates on CRE loans held by banks edged
down further in the first quarter, the delinquency rates
on loans in CMBS pools continued to increase. The rise
in CMBS delinquency rates was mostly confined to loans
that were originated during the period of weak underwriting before the financial crisis. The increase in those
delinquencies had generally been expected by market
participants and was not anticipated to have a material
effect on credit availability or market conditions.
Residential mortgage rates declined slightly, in line with
yields on longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, but remained elevated relative to the third quarter of 2016. Despite the higher level of mortgage rates,
growth in mortgage lending for home purchases remained near the upper end of its recent range during the
first quarter. Delinquency rates on residential mortgage
loans continued to edge down amid robust house price
growth and still-tight lending standards for households
with low credit scores and hard-to-document incomes.
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally accommodative, although some indicators pointed to modest reductions in credit availability
in recent months. Tighter conditions for credit card borrowing were especially apparent within the subprime
segment, where there had been some further deterioration of credit performance. On a year-over-year basis,
overall credit card balances continued to grow in April
at a robust rate, although the pace had moderated a bit
from that of 2016.

Growth in auto loans remained solid through the first
quarter. Overall delinquency rates on auto loans continued to be relatively low, but the delinquency rate among
subprime borrowers remained elevated, reflecting easier
lending standards in 2015 and 2016. Recent evidence
suggested that these lending standards had tightened; the
credit rating of the average borrower had trended higher,
and new extensions of subprime auto loans had declined.
Over the period since the May FOMC meeting, foreign
financial markets were influenced by incoming economic data and by political developments both abroad
and in the United States. Most AFE and EME equity
indexes edged higher, supported by robust first-quarter
earnings reports and generally positive data releases
overseas. The broad U.S. dollar depreciated about
1¾ percent over the intermeeting period, weakening
against both AFE and EME currencies. In particular,
the dollar depreciated against the Canadian dollar following communications by the Bank of Canada suggesting that the removal of policy accommodation could occur sooner than previously expected by market participants. The dollar also depreciated against the euro,
which was supported by the results of the French presidential election and by stronger-than-expected macroeconomic releases. Those data releases prompted the
European Central Bank at its June 8 meeting to change
its assessment of risks to the economic outlook from
“tilted to the downside” to “balanced.” U.S. developments, including mixed economic data reports, also
weighed on the dollar. In contrast, the dollar strengthened against sterling following the U.K. parliamentary
election. Changes in longer-dated AFE sovereign bond
yields were mixed, while shorter-dated yields moved
slightly higher. EME sovereign spreads were little
changed, while flows into EME mutual funds remained
robust. However, Brazilian sovereign spreads widened
and the Brazilian real depreciated notably amid increased
political uncertainty.
Staff Economic Outlook
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff
for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was forecast to step up to a solid pace in the second quarter following its weak reading in the first quarter, primarily reflecting faster real PCE growth. On balance, the incoming data on aggregate spending were a little stronger than
the staff had expected, and the forecast of real GDP
growth for the current year was a bit higher than in the
previous projection. Beyond this year, the projection for
real GDP growth was essentially unchanged. The staff
continued to project that real GDP would expand at a

Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2017
Page 7
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017
through 2019, supported in part by the staff’s maintained assumption that fiscal policy would become more
expansionary in the coming years. The unemployment
rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff’s
estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as
measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised down slightly for 2017 because of the weaker-thanexpected incoming data for inflation. However, the projection was little changed thereafter, as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory. Inflation was
still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last
year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food
and non-energy imports. The staff projected that inflation would increase further in the next couple of years,
and that it would be close to the Committee’s longer-run
objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019.
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. Many
financial market indicators of uncertainty were subdued,
and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook
appeared to have subsided further, on balance, since late
last year; these developments were judged as counterweights to elevated measures of economic policy uncertainty. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real
GDP and the unemployment rate as balanced; the staff’s
assessment was that the downside risks associated with
monetary policy not being well positioned to respond to
adverse shocks had diminished since its previous forecast. The risks to the projection for inflation also were
seen as roughly balanced. The downside risks from the
possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may
have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the
upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the
Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presFour members of the Board of Governors, one fewer than
in March 2017, were in office at the time of the June 2017
meeting and submitted economic projections. The office of
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was

4

idents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate,
and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2019 and
over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. 4
The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable
would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further
shocks to the economy. 5 These projections and policy
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic
Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these
minutes.
In their discussion of the economic situation and the
outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period indicated
that the labor market had continued to strengthen and
that economic activity had been rising moderately, on
average, so far this year. Job gains had moderated since
the beginning of the year but had remained solid, on average, and the unemployment rate had declined. Household spending had picked up in recent months, and business fixed investment had continued to expand. Inflation measured on a 12-month basis had declined recently
and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices,
had been running somewhat below 2 percent. Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained
low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
Participants generally saw the incoming information on
spending and labor market indicators as consistent,
overall, with their expectations and indicated that their
views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor
market had changed only slightly since the May FOMC
meeting. As anticipated, growth in consumer spending
seemed to have bounced back from a weak first quarter,
and participants continued to expect that, with further
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy,
economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and
labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat
further. In light of surprisingly low recent readings on
inflation, participants expected that inflation on a
12-month basis would remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term. However, participants judged that

vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; First Vice President
Mark L. Mullinix submitted economic projections.
5 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal
funds rate.

inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
Growth in consumer spending appeared to be rebounding after slowing in the first quarter of this year. Participants generally continued to expect that ongoing job
gains, rising household income and wealth, and improved household balance sheets would support moderate growth in household spending over the medium
term. However, District contacts reported that automobile sales had slowed recently; some contacts expected
sales to slow further, while others believed that sales
were leveling out.
Participants generally agreed that business fixed investment had continued to expand in recent months, supported in particular by a rebound in the energy sector.
District contacts suggested that an expansion in oil production capacity was likely to continue in the near term,
though the longer-term outlook was more uncertain.
Conditions in the manufacturing sector in several Districts were reportedly strong, but activity in a couple of
them had slowed in recent months from a high level, and
some contacts in the automobile industry reported declines in production that they expected to continue in
the near term. District reports regarding the service sector were generally positive. In contrast, contacts in a
couple of Districts indicated that conditions in the agricultural sector remained weak. Contacts in many Districts remained optimistic about business prospects,
which were supported in part by improving global conditions. However, this optimism appeared to have recently abated somewhat, partly because contacts viewed
the likelihood of significant fiscal stimulus as having diminished. Contacts at some large firms indicated that
they had curtailed their capital spending, in part because
of uncertainty about changes in fiscal and other government policies; some contacts at smaller firms, however,
indicated that their capital spending plans had not been
appreciably affected by news about government policy.
Reports regarding housing construction from District
contacts were mixed.
Labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months. The unemployment rate fell from 4.5 percent in March to 4.3 percent in May and was below levels
that participants judged likely to be normal over the
longer run. Monthly increases in nonfarm payrolls averaged 160,000 since the beginning of the year, down from
187,000 per month in 2016 but still well above estimates
of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants in the labor
force. A few participants interpreted this slowing in payroll growth as an expected development that reflected a

tight labor market. Other labor market indicators, such
as the number of job openings and broader measures of
unemployment, were also seen as consistent with labor
market conditions having strengthened in recent
months. Moreover, contacts in several Districts reported shortages of workers in selected occupations and
in some cases indicated that firms were significantly increasing salaries and benefits in order to attract or keep
workers. However, other contacts reported only modest
wage gains, and participants observed that measures of
labor compensation for the overall economy continued
to rise only moderately despite strengthening labor market conditions. A couple of participants saw the restrained increases in labor compensation as consistent
with the low productivity growth and moderate inflation
experienced in recent years. In light of the recent behavior of labor compensation and consumer prices as well
as demographic trends, a number of participants lowered their estimate of the longer-run normal level of the
unemployment rate.
Recent readings on headline and core PCE price inflation had come in lower than participants had expected.
On a 12-month basis, headline PCE price inflation was
running somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in April, partly because of factors that appeared
to be transitory. Core PCE price inflation—which historically has been a more useful predictor of future inflation, although it, too, can be affected by transitory factors—moved down from 1.8 percent in March to
1.5 percent in April. In addition, CPI inflation in May
came in lower than expected. Most participants viewed
the recent softness in these price data as largely reflecting
idiosyncratic factors, including sharp declines in prices
of wireless telephone services and prescription drugs,
and expected these developments to have little bearing
on inflation over the medium run. Participants continued to expect that, as the effects of transitory factors
waned and labor market conditions strengthened further, inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s
2 percent objective over the medium term. Several participants suggested that recent increases in import prices
were consistent with this expectation. However, several
participants expressed concern that progress toward the
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective
might have slowed and that the recent softness in inflation might persist. Such persistence might occur in part
because upward pressure on inflation from resource utilization may be limited, as the relationship between these
two variables appeared to be weaker than in previous
decades. However, a couple of other participants raised
the concern that a tighter relationship between inflation

Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2017

and resource utilization could reemerge if the unemployment rate ran significantly below its longer-run normal
level, which could result in inflation running persistently
above the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
Overall, participants continued to see the near-term risks
to the economic outlook as roughly balanced. Participants again noted the uncertainty regarding the possible
enactment, timing, and nature of changes to fiscal and
other government policies and saw both upside and
downside risks to the economic outlook associated with
such changes. A number of participants, pointing to improved prospects for foreign economic growth, viewed
the downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook stemming from international developments as having receded further over the intermeeting period. With regard
to the outlook for inflation, some participants emphasized downside risks, particularly in light of the recent
low readings on inflation along with measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures of inflation expectations that were still low. However, a couple
of participants expressed concern that a substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment could pose an appreciable upside risk to inflation
or give rise to macroeconomic or financial imbalances
that eventually could lead to a significant economic
downturn. Participants agreed that the Committee
should continue to monitor inflation developments
closely.
In their discussion of recent developments in financial
markets, participants observed that, over the intermeeting period, equity prices rose, longer-term interest rates
declined, and volatility in financial markets was generally
low. They also noted that, according to some measures,
financial conditions had eased even as the Committee
reduced policy accommodation and market participants
continued to expect further steps to tighten monetary
policy. Participants discussed possible reasons why financial conditions had not tightened. Corporate earnings growth had been robust; nevertheless, in the assessment of a few participants, equity prices were high when
judged against standard valuation measures. Longerterm Treasury yields had declined since earlier in the year
and remained low. Participants offered various explanations for low bond yields, including the prospect of sluggish longer-term economic growth as well as the elevated level of the Federal Reserve’s longer-term asset
holdings. Some participants suggested that increased
risk tolerance among investors might be contributing to
elevated asset prices more broadly; a few participants expressed concern that subdued market volatility, coupled

with a low equity premium, could lead to a buildup of
risks to financial stability.
In their discussion of monetary policy, participants generally saw the outlook for economic activity and the
medium-term outlook for inflation as little changed and
viewed a continued gradual removal of monetary policy
accommodation as being appropriate. Based on this assessment, almost all participants expressed the view that
it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the
target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at
this meeting. These participants agreed that, even after
an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate
at this meeting, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting additional strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to
2 percent inflation. A few participants also judged that
the case for a policy rate increase at this meeting was
strengthened by the easing, by some measures, in overall
financial conditions over the previous six months. One
participant did not believe it was appropriate to raise the
federal funds rate target range at this meeting; this participant suggested that the Committee should maintain
the target range for the federal funds rate at ¾ to 1 percent until the inflation rate was actually moving toward
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.
Participants noted that, with the process of normalization of the level of the federal funds rate continuing, it
would likely become appropriate this year for the Committee to announce and implement a specific timetable
for its program of reducing reinvestment of the Federal
Reserve’s securities holdings. It was observed that the
ensuing reduction in securities holdings would be gradual and would follow an extended period of Committee
communications on balance sheet normalization policy,
including the information that would be released at the
conclusion of this meeting. Consequently, the effect on
financial market conditions of the eventual announcement of the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s balance
sheet normalization was expected to be limited.
Participants expressed a range of views about the appropriate timing of a change in reinvestment policy. Several
preferred to announce a start to the process within a
couple of months; in support of this approach, it was
noted that the Committee’s communications had helped
prepare the public for such a step. However, some others emphasized that deferring the decision until later in
the year would permit additional time to assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation. A few of these
participants also suggested that a near-term change to

Page 10
Federal Open Market Committee
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

reinvestment policy could be misinterpreted as signifying that the Committee had shifted toward a less gradual
approach to overall policy normalization.
Several participants indicated that the reduction in policy
accommodation arising from the commencement of balance sheet normalization was one basis for believing
that, if economic conditions evolved broadly as anticipated, the target range for the federal funds rate would
follow a less steep path than it otherwise would. However, some other participants suggested that they did not
see the balance sheet normalization program as a factor
likely to figure heavily in decisions about the target range
for the federal funds rate. A few of these participants
judged that the degree of additional policy firming that
would result from the balance sheet normalization program was modest.
Participants generally reiterated their support for continuing a gradual approach to raising the federal funds rate.
Several participants expressed confidence that a series of
further increases in the federal funds rate in coming
years, along the lines implied by the medians of the projections for the federal funds rate in the June SEP, would
contribute to a stabilization, over the medium term, of
the inflation rate around the Committee’s 2 percent objective, especially as this tightening of monetary policy
would affect the economy only with a lag and would start
from a point at which policy was still accommodative.
However, a few participants who supported an increase
in the target range at the present meeting indicated that
they were less comfortable with the degree of additional
policy tightening through the end of 2018 implied by the
June SEP median federal funds rate projections. These
participants expressed concern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent.
Several participants endorsed a policy approach, such as
that embedded in many participants’ projections, in
which the unemployment rate would undershoot their
current estimates of the longer-term normal rate for a
sustained period. They noted that the longer-run normal
rate of unemployment is difficult to measure and that
recent evidence suggested resource pressures generated
only modest responses of nominal wage growth and inflation. Against this backdrop, possible benefits cited by
policymakers of a period of tight labor markets included
a further rise in nominal wage growth that would bolster
inflation expectations and help push the inflation rate
closer to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, as

well as a stimulus to labor market participation and business fixed investment. It was also suggested that the
symmetry of the Committee’s inflation goal might be underscored if inflation modestly exceeded 2 percent for a
time, as such an outcome would follow a long period in
which inflation had undershot the 2 percent longer-term
objective. Several participants expressed concern that a
substantial and sustained unemployment undershooting
might make the economy more likely to experience financial instability or could lead to a sharp rise in inflation
that would require a rapid policy tightening that, in turn,
could raise the risk of an economic downturn. However,
other participants noted that if a sharp rise in inflation
or inflation expectations did occur, the Committee could
readily respond using conventional monetary policy
tools. With regard to financial stability, one participant
emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant about
financial developments but observed that previous episodes of elevated financial imbalances and low unemployment had limited relevance for the present situation,
as the current system of financial regulation was likely
more robust than that prevailing before the financial crisis.
Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period
ahead, members judged that information received since
the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen
and that economic activity had been rising moderately so
far this year. Job gains had moderated but had been
solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and
the unemployment rate had declined. Household spending had picked up in recent months, and business fixed
investment had continued to expand.
Inflation on a 12-month basis had declined recently and
was running somewhat below 2 percent. The measure
of inflation excluding food and energy prices was likewise running somewhat below 2 percent. Market-based
measures of inflation compensation remained low;
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.
With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate
pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen
somewhat further. Inflation on a 12-month basis was
expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the
near term, but almost all members expected it to stabilize
around 2 percent over the medium term, although they

Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2017
Page 11
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

were monitoring inflation developments closely. Members continued to judge that there was significant uncertainty about the effects of possible changes in fiscal and
other government policies but that near-term risks to the
economic outlook appeared roughly balanced, especially
as risks related to foreign economic and financial developments had diminished.
After assessing current conditions and the outlook for
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but
one member agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1¼ percent. They noted that the
stance of monetary policy remained accommodative,
thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor
market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent
inflation.
Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions,
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Members also agreed that they would carefully
monitor actual and expected developments in inflation
in relation to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal.
They expected that economic conditions would evolve
in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the
federal funds rate, and they agreed that the federal funds
rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that
are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the
actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on
the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
The Committee also decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over
maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee
expected to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program in 2017, provided that the economy
evolves broadly as anticipated. This program, which
would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities
holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities, was described in an addendum to the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans to be released after this meeting.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank

of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the
following domestic policy directive, to be released at
2:00 p.m.:
“Effective June 15, 2017, the Federal Open
Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range
of 1 to 1¼ percent, including overnight reverse
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase
operations with maturities of more than one day
when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.00 percent, in amounts limited only
by the value of Treasury securities held outright
in the System Open Market Account that are
available for such operations and by a percounterparty limit of $30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee also directs the Desk
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed
securities transactions.”
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
“Information received since the Federal Open
Market Committee met in May indicates that
the labor market has continued to strengthen
and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the
beginning of the year, and the unemployment
rate has declined. Household spending has
picked up in recent months, and business fixed
investment has continued to expand. On a
12-month basis, inflation has declined recently
and, like the measure excluding food and energy
prices, is running somewhat below 2 percent.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of
longer-term inflation expectations are little
changed, on balance.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment

Page 12

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

and price stability. The Committee continues to
expect that, with gradual adjustments in the
stance of monetary policy, economic activity
will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected
to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near
term but to stabilize around the Committee’s
2 percent objective over the medium term.
Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is
monitoring inflation developments closely.
In view of realized and expected labor market
conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal
funds rate to 1 to 1¼ percent. The stance of
monetary policy remains accommodative,
thereby supporting some further strengthening
in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized
and expected economic conditions relative to its
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including
measures of labor market conditions, indicators
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations,
and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully
monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in
the longer run. However, the actual path of the
federal funds rate will depend on the economic
outlook as informed by incoming data.

In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted
by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of
Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago,
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 1¾ percent primary credit rate by the remaining

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy
of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury
securities at auction. The Committee currently
expects to begin implementing a balance sheet
normalization program this year, provided that
the economy evolves broadly as anticipated.
This program, which would gradually reduce
the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments
from those securities, is described in the accompanying addendum to the Committee’s Policy
Normalization Principles and Plans.”
Voting for this action: Janet L. Yellen, William C.
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley
Fischer, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, and Jerome
H. Powell.
Voting against this action: Neel Kashkari.
Mr. Kashkari dissented because he preferred to maintain
the existing target range for the federal funds rate at this
meeting. In his view, recent data, while suggesting that
the labor market had improved further, had increased
doubts about achievement of the Committee’s 2 percent
longer-run inflation objective and thus had not provided
a compelling basis on which to firm monetary policy at
this meeting. He preferred to await additional evidence
that the recent decline in inflation was temporary and
that inflation was moving toward the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. He was concerned
that raising the federal funds rate target range too soon
increased the likelihood that inflation expectations
would decline and that inflation would continue to run
below 2 percent.
To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required
and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to
1¼ percent, effective June 15, 2017. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate (discount
rate) to 1¾ percent, effective June 15, 2017. 6
Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of June 15, 2017,

Summary of Economic Projections
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June 13–14, 2017, meeting
participants submitted their projections of the most
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 2019
and over the longer run. 1 Each participant’s projection
was based on information available at the time of the
meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy, including a path for the federal
funds rate and its longer-run value, and assumptions
about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. 2
The longer-run projections represent each participant’s
assessment of the value to which each variable would be
expected to converge, over time, under appropriate
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to
the economy. 3 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant
deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual
interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of
maximum employment and stable prices.
All participants who submitted longer-run projections
expected that, under appropriate monetary policy,
growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) this year
would run somewhat above their individual estimates of
its longer-run rate. Over half of these participants expected that economic growth would slow a bit in 2018,
and almost all of them expected that in 2019 economic
growth would run at or near its longer-run level. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected
that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer-run normal level in 2017 and remain
below that level through 2019. The majority of participants also lowered their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage
point. All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE),
would run below 2 percent in 2017 and then step up in
the next two years; over half of them projected that inflation would be at the Committee’s 2 percent objective
Four members of the Board of Governors, one fewer than
in March 2017, were in office at the time of the June 2017
meeting and submitted economic projections. The office of
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was
vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; First Vice President
Mark L. Mullinix submitted economic projections.

1

in 2019, and all judged that inflation would be within a
couple of tenths of a percentage point of the objective
in that year. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections.
As shown in figure 2, participants generally expected
that evolving economic conditions would likely warrant
further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to
achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Although some participants raised or
lowered their federal funds rate projections since March,
the median projections for the federal funds rate in 2017
and 2018 were essentially unchanged, and the median
projection in 2019 was slightly lower; the median projection for the longer-run federal funds rate was unchanged. However, the economic outlook is uncertain,
and participants noted that their economic projections
and assessments of appropriate monetary policy could
change in response to incoming information.
In general, participants viewed the uncertainty attached
to their projections as broadly similar to the average of
the past 20 years, although a couple of participants saw
the uncertainty associated with their real GDP growth
forecasts as higher than average. Most participants
judged the risks around their projections for economic
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly
balanced.
Figures 4.A through 4.C for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, respectively, present
“fan charts” as well as charts of participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding the
economic projections. The fan charts (the panels at the
top of these three figures) show the median projections
surrounded by confidence intervals that are computed
from the forecast errors of various private and government projections made over the past 20 years. The
width of the confidence interval for each variable at a
given point is a measure of forecast uncertainty at that
horizon. For all three macroeconomic variables, these
charts illustrate that forecast uncertainty is substantial
and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.
All participants submitted their projections in advance of the
FOMC meeting; no projections were revised following the release of economic data on the morning of June 14.
3 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal
funds rate.

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are percent changes from the
fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change
in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for
the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are
based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each
variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the
federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target
level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The March projections were made in conjunction with
the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 14–15, 2017. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real
GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the March 14–15, 2017, meeting, and one participant did not submit such
projections in conjunction with the June 13–14, 2017, meeting.
1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections
is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.

Reflecting, in part, the uncertainty about the future evolution of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy are also subject to considerable uncertainty.
To illustrate the uncertainty regarding the appropriate
path for monetary policy, figure 5 shows a comparable
fan chart around the median projections for the federal
funds rate. 4 As with the macroeconomic variables, forecast uncertainty for the federal funds rate is substantial
and increases at longer horizons.
The Outlook for Economic Activity
The median of participants’ projections for the growth
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was
2.2 percent in 2017, 2.1 percent in 2018, and 1.9 percent
in 2019; the median of projections for the longer-run
normal rate of real GDP growth was 1.8 percent. Compared with the March Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the medians of the forecasts for real GDP
growth over the period from 2017 to 2019, as well as the
median assessment of the longer-run growth rate, were
mostly unchanged. Fewer than half of the participants
incorporated expectations of fiscal stimulus into their
projections, and a couple indicated that they had marked
down the magnitude of expected fiscal stimulus relative
to March.
All participants revised down their projections for the
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 and of
2018, and almost all also revised down their projections
for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Many who did so cited recent lower-than-expected readings on unemployment. The median of the projections
for the unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in 2017 and
4.2 percent in each of 2018 and 2019, 0.2 percentage
point and 0.3 percentage point lower than in the March
projections, respectively. The majority of participants
also revised down their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment by 0.1 or 0.2 percentage
point, and the median longer-run level was 4.6 percent,
down 0.1 percentage point from March.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2017 to 2019 and in the longer run.
The distribution of individual projections for real GDP
growth for this year shifted up, with some participants
now expecting real GDP growth between 2.4 and

and is closely connected with the uncertainty about the future

2.5 percent and none seeing it below 2 percent. The distributions of projected real GDP growth in 2018, 2019,
and in the longer run were broadly similar to the distributions of the March projections. The distributions of
individual projections for the unemployment rate shifted
down noticeably for 2017 and 2018. Most participants
projected an unemployment rate of 4.2 or 4.3 percent at
the end of this year, and the majority anticipated an unemployment rate between 4.0 and 4.3 percent at the end
of 2018. Participants’ projections also shifted down in
2019 but were more dispersed than the distributions of
their projected unemployment rates in the two earlier
years. The distribution of projections for the longer-run
normal unemployment rate shifted down modestly.
The Outlook for Inflation
The median of projections for headline PCE price inflation this year was 1.6 percent, down 0.3 percentage point
from March. As in March, median projected inflation
was 2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019. About half of the
participants anticipated that inflation would continue to
run a bit below 2 percent in 2018, while only one participant expected inflation above 2 percent in that year—
and, in that case, just modestly so. More than half projected that inflation would be equal to the Committee’s
objective in 2019. A few participants projected that inflation would run slightly below 2 percent in that year,
while several projected that it would run a little above
2 percent. The median of projections for core PCE
price inflation was 1.7 percent in 2017, a decline of
0.2 percentage point from March; the median projection
for 2018 and 2019 was 2.0 percent, as in the March projections.
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation. The distributions of projections for headline
PCE price inflation and for core PCE price inflation in
2017 shifted down noticeably from March, while the distributions for both measures of inflation in 2018 shifted
down slightly. Many participants cited recent surprisingly low readings on inflation as a factor contributing
to the revisions in their inflation forecasts.
Appropriate Monetary Policy
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’
judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint
of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end
in figure 2 displays the dispersion of views across individual
participants about the appropriate level of the federal funds
rate.

NOTE: Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root

described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions,
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the
past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip

of each year from 2017 to 2019 and over the longer run. 5
The distribution for 2017 was less dispersed than that in
March, while the distribution for 2018 was slightly less
dispersed. The distributions in 2019 and in the longer
run were broadly similar to those in March. The median
projections of the federal funds rate continued to show
gradual increases, with the median assessment for 2017
standing at 1.38 percent, consistent with three 25 basis
point increases this year. Thereafter, the medians of the
projections were 2.13 percent at the end of 2018 and
2.94 percent at the end of 2019; the median of the
longer-run projections of the federal funds rate was
3.00 percent.
In discussing their June projections, many participants
continued to express the view that the appropriate upward trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next
few years would likely be gradual. That anticipated pace
reflected a few factors, such as a neutral real interest rate
that was currently low and was expected to move up only
One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, real
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed by the view that there are multiple possible mediumterm regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent, and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way

slowly as well as a gradual return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Several participants judged
that a slightly more accommodative path of monetary
policy than in their previous projections would likely be
appropriate, citing an apparently slower rate of progress
toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. In
their discussions of appropriate monetary policy, half of
the participants commented on the Committee’s reinvestment policy; all of those who did so expected a
change in reinvestment policy before the end of this
year.
Uncertainty and Risks
Projections of economic variables are subject to considerable uncertainty. In assessing the path of monetary
policy that, in their view, is likely to be most appropriate,
FOMC participants take account of the range of possible
outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs to the economy should they
occur. Table 2 provides one measure of forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment
rate, and total consumer price inflation—the root mean
squared error (RMSE) for forecasts made over the past
20 years. This measure of forecast uncertainty is incorporated graphically in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B,
and 4.C, which display fan charts plotting the median
SEP projections for the three variables surrounded by
symmetric confidence intervals derived from the
RMSEs presented in table 2. If the degree of uncertainty
attending these projections is similar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and if the risks around the
projections are broadly balanced, future outcomes of
these variables would have about a 70 percent probability of occurring within these confidence intervals. For
all three variables, this measure of forecast uncertainty is
substantial and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.
FOMC participants may judge that the width of the historical fan charts shown in figures 4.A through 4.C does
not adequately capture their current assessments of the
degree of uncertainty that surrounds their economic
projections. Participants’ assessments of the current
level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A,
4.B, and 4.C. All or nearly all participants viewed the
that cannot be forecast. Under this view, the economy currently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic
activity with low productivity growth and a low short-term real
interest rate, but longer-term outcomes for variables other
than inflation cannot be usefully projected.

uncertainty attached to their economic projections as
broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, with
three fewer participants than in March seeing uncertainty
about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as higher than its historical average. 6 In their discussion of the uncertainty attached to their current projections, most participants again expressed the view that,
at this point, uncertainty surrounding prospective
changes in fiscal and other government policies is very
large or that there is not yet enough information to make
reasonable assumptions about the timing, nature, and
magnitude of the changes.
The fan charts—which are constructed so as to be symmetric around the median projections—also may not
fully reflect participants’ current assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections. Participants’
assessments of the balance of risks to their economic
projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. As in March, most participants
judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth,
the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly
consistent with a symmetric fan chart. Three participants judged the risks to the unemployment rate as
weighted to the downside, and one participant judged
the risks as weighted to the upside (as shown in the
lower-right panel of figure 4.B). In addition, the balance
of risks to participants’ inflation projections shifted

discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projections.

down slightly from March (shown in the lower-right
panels of figure 4.C), as two fewer participants judged
the risks to inflation to be weighted to the upside and
two more viewed the risks as weighted to the downside.
Participants’ assessments of the future path of the federal funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are also
subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting in part uncertainty about the evolution of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation over time. The final line
in table 2 shows the RMSEs for forecasts of short-term
interest rates. These RMSEs are not strictly consistent
with the SEP projections for the federal funds rate, in
part because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the
likeliest outcomes but rather reflect each participant’s individual assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
However, the associated confidence intervals provide a
sense of the likely uncertainty around the future path of
the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about
the macroeconomic variables and additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.
Figure 5 shows a fan chart plotting the median SEP projections for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate
surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the results presented in table 2. As with the macroeconomic
variables, forecast uncertainty is substantial and increases at longer horizons. 7

zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal
funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past.
This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan
chart would be merely a convention and would not have any
implication for possible future policy decisions regarding the
use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary
policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.
The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.
* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty
The economic projections provided by the members of
the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis
for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these
projections, however. The economic and statistical models
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad
unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP)
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of,
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the
past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand
within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.0 to
5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the
third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the
current year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third
years. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence
bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on
the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in
some instances, the risks around the projections may not be
symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be
negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in
which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.
Because current conditions may differ from those that
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is,
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather
than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable
uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that
point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges
for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections
of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted,
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of
shocks to the economy.
If at some point in the future the confidence interval
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the
Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention;
it would not have any implications for possible future policy
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so
were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset
purchases, to provide additional accommodation.
While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1
provides information on the range of views across FOMC
participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast
errors over the past 20 years.
