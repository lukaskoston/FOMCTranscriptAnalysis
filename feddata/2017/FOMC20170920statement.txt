Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has
been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains have remained solid in recent months,
and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending has been expanding at a
moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters.
On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices
have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of
inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation
expectations are little changed, on balance.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have devastated
many communities, inflicting severe hardship. Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding
will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the
storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the
medium term. Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a
moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Higher
prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes will likely
boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month basis is
expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the
Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic
outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation
developments closely.

In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4
percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting
some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent
inflation.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions
relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This
assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of
labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and
readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully
monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation
goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will
warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to
remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.
However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as
informed by incoming data.
In October, the Committee will initiate the balance sheet normalization program
described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee’s Policy Normalization
Principles and Plans.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair;
William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L. Evans; Stanley Fischer;
Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; and Jerome H. Powell.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on September 20, 2017:
•

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain
the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 1.25 percent.

•

As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and
direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed
otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance
with the following domestic policy directive:
“Effective September 21, 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the
Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal
funds rate in a target range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent, including overnight reverse
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more
than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar
trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.00 percent, in amounts limited only
by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market
Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of
$30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction Treasury
securities maturing during September, and to continue reinvesting in agency
mortgage-backed securities the principal payments received through September
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed
securities.
Effective in October 2017, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction
the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $6 billion,
and to reinvest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency
mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $4
billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are
acceptable.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap
transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency
mortgage-backed securities transactions.”

In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level
of 1.75 percent.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market
Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools
and approach used to implement monetary policy.

reducing reinvestments may be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website.
