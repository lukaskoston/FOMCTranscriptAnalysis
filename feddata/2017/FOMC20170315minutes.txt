Developments in Financial Markets and Open
Market Operations
The manager of the System Open Market Account
(SOMA) reported on developments in U.S. and global

financial markets during the period since the Committee
met on January 31 and February 1, 2017. Global equity
prices generally increased further, credit spreads on corporate debt and emerging market bonds narrowed, and
yields on Treasury securities rose somewhat. In survey
responses, market participants again reported elevated
uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. economic policies
and about financial asset prices, but various measures of
implied volatility nonetheless declined further. The
monetary policies of other advanced-economy central
banks remained quite accommodative, and some signs
of progress on central banks’ inflation mandates were
evident. Late in the intermeeting period, market participants came to interpret U.S. monetary policy communications as implying high odds of a firming of monetary
policy at this meeting, and changes in market prices suggested a slightly steeper path for the federal funds rate
over the next few years than was previously anticipated.
Survey results indicated that market participants saw a
change in the FOMC’s policy of reinvesting principal
payments on its securities holdings as most likely to be
announced in late 2017 or the first half of 2018. Most
market participants anticipated that, once a change to reinvestment policy was announced, reinvestments would
most likely be phased out rather than stopped all at once.
The deputy manager followed with a briefing on developments in money markets and open market operations.
Over the intermeeting period, federal funds continued
to trade near the center of the Committee’s ½ to ¾ percent target range except on month-ends. Spreads of
rates on market repurchase agreements (repos) over the
rate at the System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility remained relatively low. Market
participants attributed some of the recent decline in market repo rates to a reduction in the supply of Treasury
bills in advance of the reinstatement of the statutory debt
limit on March 16. The lower market repo rates had led
to moderately higher take-up at the ON RRP facility in
recent weeks.
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open
Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in
foreign currencies for the System’s account during the
intermeeting period.
System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy
The staff provided several briefings that summarized issues related to potential changes to the Committee’s policy of reinvesting principal payments from securities
held in the SOMA. These briefings discussed the macroeconomic implications of alternative strategies the

Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017
Page 3
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Committee could employ with respect to reinvestments,
including making the timing of an end to reinvestments
either date dependent or dependent on economic conditions. The briefings also considered the advantages and
disadvantages of phasing out reinvestments or ending
them all at once as well as whether using the same approach would be appropriate for both Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
In their discussion, policymakers reaffirmed the approach to balance sheet normalization articulated in the
Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans
announced in September 2014. In particular, participants agreed that reductions in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings should be gradual and predictable, and
accomplished primarily by phasing out reinvestments of
principal received from those holdings. Most participants expressed the view that changes in the target range
for the federal funds rate should be the primary means
for adjusting the stance of monetary policy when the
federal funds rate was above its effective lower bound.
A number of participants indicated that the Committee
should resume asset purchases only if substantially adverse economic circumstances warranted greater monetary policy accommodation than could be provided by
lowering the federal funds rate to the effective lower
bound. Moreover, it was noted that the Committee’s
policy of maintaining reinvestments until normalization
of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way
had supported the smooth and effective conduct of
monetary policy and had helped maintain accommodative financial conditions.
Consistent with the Policy Normalization Principles and
Plans, nearly all participants preferred that the timing of
a change in reinvestment policy depend on an assessment of economic and financial conditions. Several participants indicated that the timing should be based on a
quantitative threshold or trigger tied to the target range
for the federal funds rate. Some other participants expressed the view that the timing should depend on a
qualitative judgment about economic and financial conditions. Such a judgment would importantly encompass
an assessment by the Committee of the risks to the outlook, including the degree of confidence that evolving
circumstances would not soon require a reversal in the
direction of policy. Taking these considerations into account, policymakers discussed the likely level of the federal funds rate when a change in the Committee’s reinvestment policy would be appropriate. Provided that the
economy continued to perform about as expected, most
participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change

to the Committee’s reinvestment policy would likely be
appropriate later this year. Many participants emphasized that reducing the size of the balance sheet should
be conducted in a passive and predictable manner. Some
participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate for the Committee to restart reinvestments if the
economy encountered significant adverse shocks that required a reduction in the target range for the federal
funds rate.
When the time comes to implement a change to reinvestment policy, participants generally preferred to
phase out or cease reinvestments of both Treasury securities and agency MBS. Policymakers also discussed the
potential benefits and costs of approaches that would either phase out or cease all at once reinvestments of principal from these securities. An approach that phased out
reinvestments was seen as reducing the risks of triggering financial market volatility or of potentially sending
misleading signals about the Committee’s policy intentions while only modestly slowing reductions in the
Committee’s securities holdings. An approach that
ended reinvestments all at once, however, was generally
viewed as easier to communicate while allowing for
somewhat swifter normalization of the size of the balance sheet. To promote rapid normalization of the size
and composition of the balance sheet, one participant
preferred to set a minimum pace for reductions in MBS
holdings and, if and when necessary, to sell MBS to
maintain such a pace.
Nearly all participants agreed that the Committee’s intentions regarding reinvestment policy should be communicated to the public well in advance of an actual
change. It was noted that the Committee would continue its deliberations on reinvestment policy during upcoming meetings and would release additional information as it becomes available. In that context, several
participants indicated that, when the Committee announces its plans for a change to its reinvestment policy,
it would be desirable to also provide more information
to the public about the Committee’s expectations for the
size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s assets and
liabilities in the longer run.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the March 14–15 meeting
suggested that the labor market strengthened further in
January and February and that real gross domestic product (GDP) was continuing to expand in the first quarter,
albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter, with
some of the slowing likely reflecting transitory factors.
The 12-month change in consumer prices moved up in

Page 4
Federal Open Market Committee
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

recent months and was close to the Committee’s longerrun objective of 2 percent; excluding food and energy
prices, inflation was little changed and continued to run
somewhat below 2 percent.
Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a brisk
pace in January and February. The unemployment rate
edged back down to 4.7 percent in February, and the labor force participation rate rose over the first two
months of the year. The share of workers employed part
time for economic reasons was little changed on net.
The rate of private-sector job openings was unchanged
at a high level in December, while the rate of hiring
edged up and the rate of quits edged down. The fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment
insurance benefits was at a very low level in early March.
Measures of labor compensation continued to rise at a
moderate rate. Compensation per hour in the nonfarm
business sector increased 3¼ percent over the four quarters of 2016, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2¾ percent over the 12 months ending in
February. The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession, but the
unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites. Over the past
year or so, the jobless rate for African Americans moved
lower, while the rates for Hispanics and for whites
moved roughly sideways.
Total industrial production declined in January, as unseasonably warm weather reduced the demand for heating, which held down the output of utilities. Mining output expanded further following a large gain in the fourth
quarter, and manufacturing production continued to rise
at a modest pace. Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that motor vehicle production would remain near
its January pace, on average, over the next few months,
while broader indicators of manufacturing production,
such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further modest
gains in factory output over the near term.
Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to be rising at a slower pace in the first quarter
than in the fourth quarter. Motor vehicle sales stepped
down in January and February from their brisk year-end
pace, and unseasonably warm weather prompted a further decline in consumer spending for energy services.
Taken together, the components of the nominal retail
sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to
construct its estimate of PCE were unchanged in February after a robust gain in January. Recent readings on

some key factors that influence consumer spending—
including further gains in employment, real disposable
personal income, and households’ net worth—were
consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early
2017. In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained at an elevated level in February.
Recent information on housing activity suggested that
residential investment increased at a solid pace early in
the year. Starts for both new single-family homes and
multifamily units strengthened in the fourth quarter and
remained near those levels in January. Issuance of building permits for new single-family homes—which tends
to be a reliable indicator of the underlying trend in construction—also moved up in the fourth quarter and remained near that level in January. Sales of existing
homes rose in January, while new home sales maintained
their fourth-quarter pace.
Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to be rising in the first quarter after a moderate gain in the fourth quarter. Nominal
new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft recorded a solid net gain over the three months
ending in January, and indicators of business sentiment
were upbeat. Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining was fairly flat
in recent months, but the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for
structures in the drilling and mining sector, continued to
increase through early March. The limited available data
suggested that inventory investment was likely to make
a smaller contribution to real GDP growth in the early
part of the year than it did in the fourth quarter.
Total real government purchases appeared to be moving
sideways in the first quarter after having been little
changed in the fourth quarter. Nominal outlays for defense in January and February pointed to an increase in
real federal purchases. Although state and local government payrolls expanded in January and February, nominal construction spending by these governments fell
sharply in January.
Net exports exerted a significant drag on real GDP
growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the January
trade data suggested that net exports would continue to
weigh on growth in the first quarter of this year. The
U.S. international trade deficit widened in January in
nominal terms, with imports—led by consumer
goods—rising more than exports. Over the past six
months, nominal imports grew at a much faster
pace than nominal exports.

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE
price index, increased a little less than 2 percent over the
12 months ending in January. Core PCE price inflation,
which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was
1¾ percent over those same 12 months, held down in
part by decreases in the prices of non­energy imports
over part of this period. Over the 12 months ending in
February, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2¾ percent, while core CPI
inflation was 2¼ percent. The medians of survey-based
measures of longer-run inflation expectations—such as
those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary
Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little
changed, on balance, in recent months.
Foreign real GDP growth slowed a bit in the fourth
quarter from a relatively strong rate in the third quarter,
but it was still somewhat higher than its average pace
over the past two years. In much of the world, including
Europe, Japan, and most of emerging Asia, economic
activity continued to grow at a moderate pace. In Canada and Mexico—two important trading partners of the
United States—growth stepped down from unusually
strong third-quarter rates to a still-solid pace in the
fourth quarter, and Brazil’s recession deepened. Recently released purchasing managers indexes and confidence indicators from abroad were generally upbeat and
pointed to continued moderate foreign growth in early
2017, although indicators from Mexico suggested a further slowing. Inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) continued to rise, largely reflecting increases in retail energy prices and currency depreciation.
Among the emerging market economies (EMEs), inflation rose in Mexico, in part reflecting a substantial hike
in fuel prices, but fell in China and parts of South America.
Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Financial markets were generally quiet over the intermeeting period. The Committee’s decision to keep the
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the
January–February FOMC meeting was well anticipated.
Broad equity price indexes rose further, leaving some
standard measures of valuations above historical norms.
Treasury yields rose late in the intermeeting period, following monetary policy communications by several Federal Reserve officials. The broad dollar index was about
unchanged. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses, households, and state and local governments remained generally accommodative in recent months.

Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting
period contributed to increased expectations of a decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at
the March meeting. The Chair’s semiannual monetary
policy testimony reportedly led market participants to
price in a slightly higher probability of a monetary policy
firming in the near term. Subsequently, investors took
note of the mention in the minutes of the January–
February FOMC meeting that many participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate to raise the
federal funds rate again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with
or stronger than their current expectations or if the risks
of overshooting the Committee’s maximumemployment and inflation objectives increased. Late in
the period, communications from several Federal Reserve officials led to an increase in market-based
measures of the probability that the target range for the
federal funds rate would rise at the March meeting.
Nominal Treasury yields increased over the intermeeting
period, particularly for shorter maturities. Treasury
yields reacted only modestly over most of the period to
domestic economic data releases that were reportedly
seen as a little stronger than expected on balance. Yields
on longer-dated Treasury securities rose late in the period following comments by Federal Reserve officials. Measures of inflation compensation based on
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little
changed, on net, since the February FOMC meeting.
Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, and some measures of valuations, such
as price-to-earnings ratios, rose further above historical
norms. A standard measure of the equity risk premium
edged lower, declining into the lower quartile of its historical distribution of the previous three decades. Stock
prices rose across most industries, and equity prices for
financial firms outperformed broader indexes. Meanwhile, spreads of yields on bonds issued by nonfinancial
corporations over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed.
Since the previous FOMC meeting, better-thanexpected economic data and earnings releases abroad
also supported risk sentiment: Foreign equity prices increased, flows to emerging market mutual funds picked
up, and emerging market bond spreads narrowed. Consistent with improved sentiment toward the EMEs, the
dollar depreciated against EME currencies. The Mexican peso appreciated substantially against the dollar, although it remained weaker than just before the U.S. elections. In contrast, the dollar appreciated against the

Page 6

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

AFE currencies, reflecting continued divergence in
monetary policy expectations for the United States and
AFEs as well as political uncertainty in Europe. The
broad dollar index was little changed over the period.
Sovereign yields in AFEs generally increased slightly. In
the United Kingdom, however, gilt yields declined and
the pound weakened against the dollar in response to
weaker-than-expected inflation data and to an upward
revision by the Bank of England, at its early February
policy meeting, of its assessment of the degree of slack
in the labor market. As expected by market participants,
the European Central Bank, at its meeting in early
March, kept its policy rate and the pace of its asset purchases unchanged.
In U.S. financial markets, credit flows to large firms remained solid in recent months, with strong bond issuance by investment-grade corporations and brisk originations of leveraged loans. Bank loans continued to be
largely available for small businesses, although small
business credit demand reportedly remained subdued.
In the municipal bond market, issuance was strong in
January but decreased somewhat in February. Yields increased a little, about in line with the rise in Treasury
yields. The number of ratings upgrades notably outpaced the number of downgrades in January and February.
Commercial real estate loans on banks’ books continued
to grow in January and February. Spreads on highly
rated commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)
over Treasury securities were little changed. However,
the volumes of CMBS issuance and of deals in the pipeline were lower in the first two months of the year than
in each of the previous two years. Market commentators
attributed some of the slowdown to the response of issuers to risk retention rules that took effect in late 2016.
The delinquency rate on loans in CMBS pools had risen
since the spring of 2016, reflecting increased delinquencies on loans originated before the financial crisis.
Mortgage credit continued to be readily available for
households with strong credit scores and documented
incomes. Despite the increase in Treasury yields, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was little
changed over the intermeeting period. Closed-end residential mortgage loans on banks’ books were about flat
in January and February, while banks’ holdings of home
equity lines of credit continued their long contraction.
Financing conditions in the market for asset-backed securities remained favorable. Consumer credit continued
to increase at a steady pace, with similar growth rates
across credit card, automobile, and student loans. The

growth of consumer lending at banks continued in January and February, albeit at a slower pace than in the
fourth quarter of 2016. Financing conditions for consumers remained accommodative except in the market
for subprime credit card loans.
Staff Economic Outlook
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff
for the March FOMC meeting, the near-term forecast
for real GDP growth was a little weaker, on net, than in
the previous projection. Real GDP was expected to expand at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the
fourth quarter, reflecting some data for January that
were judged to be transitorily weak, but growth was projected to move back up in the second quarter. The staff
maintained its assumption—provisionally included starting with the December 2016 forecast—of a more expansionary fiscal policy in the coming years, but it pushed
back the timing of when those policy changes were anticipated to take effect. The negative effect of this timing
change on projected real GDP growth through 2019 was
offset by a higher assumed path for equity prices and by
a lower assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar. All told, the staff’s forecast for the level of real GDP
at the end of 2019 was essentially unrevised from the
previous forecast, and the staff continued to project that
real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than
potential output in 2017 through 2019. The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through
the end of 2019 and to run below the staff’s estimate of
its longer-run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection.
The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as
measured by changes in the PCE price index, was unchanged for 2017 as a whole and over the next couple of
years. The staff continued to project that inflation
would increase gradually over this period, as food and
energy prices, along with the prices of non-energy imports, were expected to begin steadily rising this year.
However, inflation was projected to be slightly below the
Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019.
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The
risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to
the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment
that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to
respond to large positive shocks to the economic outlook than substantial adverse ones. However, the staff
viewed the risks to the forecast as less pronounced than

Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017
Page 7
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

in the recent past, reflecting both somewhat diminished
risks to the foreign outlook and an increase in U.S. consumer and business confidence over recent months.
Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand,
the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. The risks to the
projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term
inflation expectations may have edged down or that the
dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as
roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation
could increase more than expected in an economy that
was projected to continue operating above its longer-run
potential.
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the
Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate,
and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2019 and
over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. 4
The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable
would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further
shocks to the economy. 5 These projections and policy
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic
Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these
minutes.
In their discussion of the economic situation and the
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the
labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate
pace. Job gains had remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months. Household spending had continued to rise moderately while
business fixed investment appeared to have firmed
somewhat. Inflation had increased in recent quarters
and moved close to the Committee’s 2 percent longerrun objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation
was little changed and had continued to run somewhat
below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation

Atlanta was vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; the incoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is
scheduled to assume office on June 5, 2017. Marie Gooding,

compensation had remained low; survey-based measures
of inflation compensation were little changed on balance.
Participants generally saw the incoming economic information as consistent, overall, with their expectations and
indicated that their views about the economic outlook
had changed little since the January–February FOMC
meeting. Although GDP appeared to be expanding relatively slowly in the current quarter, that development
seemed primarily to reflect temporary factors, possibly
including residual seasonality. Participants continued to
anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of
monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a
moderate pace, labor market conditions would
strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.
Participants generally judged that risks to the economic
outlook remained roughly balanced overall, although
they saw some of the considerations underlying that assessment as having changed modestly. Participants continued to underscore the considerable uncertainty about
the timing and nature of potential changes to fiscal policies as well as the size of the effects of such changes on
economic activity. However, several participants now
anticipated that meaningful fiscal stimulus would likely
not begin until 2018. In view of the substantial uncertainty, about half of the participants did not incorporate
explicit assumptions about fiscal policy in their projections. Nonetheless, most participants continued to view
the prospect of more expansionary fiscal policies as an
upside risk to their economic forecasts. At the same
time, some participants and their business contacts saw
downside risks to labor force and economic growth
from possible changes to other government policies,
such as those affecting immigration and trade. Participants generally viewed the downside risks associated
with the global economic outlook, particularly those related to the economic situation in China and Europe, as
having diminished over recent months. At the same
time, several participants cautioned that upcoming elections in EU countries posed both near-term and longerterm risks.
Regarding the outlook for inflation, several participants
noted that the apparently modest response of inflation
to measures of resource slack in recent years, along with
First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta,
submitted economic projections.
5 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal
funds rate.

inflation expectations that appeared to have remained
well anchored, limited the risk of a marked pickup in inflation as the labor market tightened further. In contrast,
some other participants continued to express concern
that a substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, if it was to occur, posed a
significant upside risk to inflation, in part because of the
possibility that the behavior of inflation could differ
from that in recent decades. Participants generally
agreed that it would be appropriate to continue to closely
monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
In their discussion of developments in the household
sector, participants agreed that consumer spending was
likely to contribute significantly to economic growth this
year. Although motor vehicle sales had fallen early in
the year and some other components of PCE had also
declined, many participants suggested that the slowdown
in consumer spending in January would likely be temporary. The slowing appeared to mainly reflect transitory
factors like lower energy consumption induced by warm
weather or delays in processing income tax refunds. In
addition, conditions conducive to growth in consumer
spending, such as a strong labor market or higher levels
of household wealth, were expected to persist. A number of participants also cited buoyant consumer confidence as potentially supporting household expenditures,
although some also mentioned that improved sentiment
did not appear to have appreciably altered the trajectory
of consumer spending so far. In the housing market,
access to mortgage credit that was still restricted for
some borrowers, constraints on buildable land in some
regions, and rising interest rates were cited as having
continued to restrain the recovery in housing.
Participants generally agreed that recent momentum in
the business sector had been sustained over the intermeeting period. Many reported that manufacturing activity in their Districts had strengthened further, and reports from the service sector were positive. Business
optimism remained elevated in a number of Districts. A
few participants reported increased capital expenditures
by businesses in their Districts, but business contacts in
several other Districts said they were waiting for more
clarity about government policy initiatives before implementing capital expansion plans. Investment in oil drilling, and particularly extraction from shale, was described
as increasing in a couple of Districts, and demand for
related production inputs was also said to be expanding.
Nonetheless, slower economic growth, ample existing
capacity, and modest returns in the energy sector were

noted as factors that were continuing to restrain overall
capital spending.
Labor market conditions had continued to improve.
Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 210,000 over the three months ending in
February, the unemployment rate edged down, and the
labor force participation rate ticked up. Some participants cited anecdotal evidence of a tightening of labor
markets. Business contacts in many Districts reported
difficulty recruiting qualified workers and indicated that
they had to either offer higher wages or hire workers
with lower qualifications than desired. A couple of participants reported that the ongoing mismatch between
the skill requirements of available jobs and the qualifications of job applicants was a factor boosting the number
of unfilled positions. Tight labor markets were said to
increasingly be a factor in businesses’ planning. More
employers reportedly were addressing the scarcity of labor by expanding vocational programs, but contacts emphasized that, to be effective, such efforts needed to be
complemented by other programs such as assistance
with child care and transportation. Shortages of production crews were said to have restricted oil drilling in a
couple of Districts. In contrast, several other participants cited evidence that some slack remained in the labor market, such as still-modest aggregate wage growth
and the unevenness of wage gains across industries, an
elevated share of employees working part time for economic reasons, or other broad measures of labor underutilization. Participants noted the continued stability
of the labor force participation rate in the face of its demographically driven downward trend. A few participants interpreted that development as suggesting that
slack in the labor market was minimal. A few others saw
it as an indication that labor force participation could increase a bit more relative to trend and thus that some
further reduction in labor market slack could occur.
Most participants still expected that if economic growth
stayed moderate, as they projected, the unemployment
rate would remain only modestly below their estimates
of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment over the
next few years. Some other participants, however, anticipated a more substantial undershoot.
Participants generally viewed the information received
over the intermeeting period as reinforcing their expectation that inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. The
12-month change in headline PCE prices increased from
1.7 percent in December to 1.9 percent in January, as the
effects of firmer consumer energy prices were registered.
Core PCE prices rose at a relatively quick pace of

Minutes of the Meeting of March 14–15, 2017

0.3 percent for the month of January, although it was
noted that residual seasonality might have exaggerated
the increase. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s
12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate had gradually increased over the past couple of years, reaching
1.9 percent in January.
Although market-based
measures of inflation compensation had remained low,
they were somewhat above the levels seen last year. In
addition, longer-term inflation expectations in the Michigan survey had been relatively stable since the beginning
of the year, while other survey measures of inflation expectations, such as the three-year-ahead measure from
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, had increased in recent months.
Notwithstanding these developments, some participants
cautioned that progress toward the Committee’s inflation objective should not be overstated; they noted that
inflation had been persistently below 2 percent during
the current economic expansion and that core inflation
on a 12-month basis was little changed in recent months
at a level below 2 percent. In contrast, a few other participants commented that recent inflation data were
stronger than they had expected and that they anticipated that inflation would reach the Committee’s objective of 2 percent this year.
In their discussion of recent developments in financial
markets, participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative despite the rise in longer-term
interest rates in recent months and continued to support
the expansion of economic activity. Many participants
discussed the implications of the rise in equity prices
over the past few months, with several of them citing it
as contributing to an easing of financial conditions. A
few participants attributed the recent equity price appreciation to expectations for corporate tax cuts or to increased risk tolerance among investors rather than to expectations of stronger economic growth. Some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures. It was observed that prices of
other risk assets, such as emerging market stocks, highyield corporate bonds, and commercial real estate, had
also risen significantly in recent months. In contrast,
prices of farmland reportedly had edged lower, in part
because low commodity prices continued to weigh on
farm income. Still, farmland valuations were said to remain quite high as gauged by standard benchmarks such
as rent-to-price ratios.
In their consideration of monetary policy, participants
generally agreed that the data over the intermeeting period were broadly in line with their expectations, providing evidence of further strengthening of labor market

conditions and ongoing progress toward the Committee’s objective of 2 percent inflation. Participants noted
that their views of the economic outlook were essentially
unchanged from those of the past couple of meetings.
Almost all participants saw the incoming data as consistent with an increase of 25 basis points in the target
range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. They
judged that, even after an increase in the target range, the
stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting some additional strengthening in labor
market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent
inflation.
With their views of the outlook for the economy little
changed, participants generally continued to judge that a
gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropriate to promote the Committee’s objectives of maximum
employment and 2 percent inflation. Participants
pointed to several reasons for their assessment that a
gradual removal of policy accommodation likely would
be appropriate. A few noted that it could take some time
for inflation to rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis, and
thus monetary policy would likely need to remain accommodative for a while longer in order to support the
economic conditions that would foster such an increase.
Several participants remarked that risk-management
considerations still argued for a gradual removal of accommodation because the proximity of the federal funds
rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on
the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse
shocks. Moreover, the neutral real rate—defined as the
real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its
potential—still appeared to be low by historical standards. Furthermore, uncertainty about current and prospective values of the neutral real rate reinforced the argument for a gradual approach to removing monetary
policy accommodation over the next few years.
Participants emphasized that they stood ready to change
their assessments of, and communications about, the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to
unanticipated developments. They pointed to several
risks that, if realized, could lead them to reassess their
views of the appropriate policy path. These risks included the possibility of stronger spending by businesses
and households as a result of improved sentiment, appreciably more expansionary fiscal policy, or a more
rapid buildup of inflationary pressures than anticipated.
In addition, a number of participants remarked that recent and prospective changes in financial conditions
posed upside risks to their economic projections, to the
extent that financial developments provided greater

Page 10

stimulus to spending than currently anticipated, as well
as downside risks to their economic projections if, for
example, financial markets were to experience a significant correction. Participants also mentioned potential
developments abroad that could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy.
Nearly all participants judged that the U.S. economy was
operating at or near maximum employment. In contrast,
participants held different views regarding prospects for
the attainment of the Committee’s inflation goal. A
number of participants noted that core inflation was a
useful indicator of future headline inflation, and the latest reading on 12-month core inflation suggested that it
could still be some time before headline inflation
reached 2 percent on a sustained basis. Moreover, several participants remarked that even though inflation was
currently not that far below the Committee’s 2 percent
objective, it was important for the Committee to remove
accommodation gradually to help ensure that inflation
would stabilize around that objective over the medium
term. These participants emphasized that a sustained return to 2 percent inflation was particularly important in
light of the persistent shortfall of inflation from its objective over the past several years. However, several
other participants judged that—with the headline PCE
price index rising nearly 2 percent and the core PCE index increasing close to 1¾ percent over the 12-month
period ending in January—the Committee essentially
had met its inflation goal or was poised to meet it later
this year. In the view of these participants, such circumstances could warrant a faster pace of scaling back accommodation than implied by the medians of participants’ assessments in the SEP.

jective for headline inflation on a sustained basis. Members generally viewed it as important to highlight that
core inflation—which excludes volatile energy and food
prices and historically has tended to be a good indicator
of future headline inflation—was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent. Moreover,
market-based measures of inflation compensation had
remained low.
With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect
that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary
policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate
pace and labor market conditions would strengthen
somewhat further. It was noted that recent increases in
consumer energy prices could cause inflation to temporarily reach or even rise a bit above 2 percent in the near
term. Members anticipated that inflation would stabilize
around 2 percent over the medium term and commented that transitory deviations above and below
2 percent were to be expected. Members continued to
judge that there was significant uncertainty about the effects of possible changes in fiscal and other government
policies but that near-term risks to the economic outlook
appeared roughly balanced. A few members noted that
domestic upside risks may have increased somewhat in
recent months, partly reflecting potential changes in fiscal policy, while some downside risks from abroad appeared to have diminished. Members agreed that they
would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators
and global economic and financial developments.

Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period
ahead, members judged that the information received
since the Committee’s previous meeting indicated that
the labor market had continued to strengthen and that
economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had changed little in recent months.
Household spending had continued to rise moderately,
while business fixed investment appeared to have firmed
somewhat.

After assessing current conditions and the outlook for
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but
one member agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent. This increase was
viewed as appropriate in light of the further progress that
had been made toward the Committee’s objectives of
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Members generally noted that the increase in the target range
did not reflect changes in their assessments of the economic outlook or the appropriate path of the federal
funds rate, adding that the increase was consistent with
the gradual pace of removal of accommodation that was
anticipated in December, when the Committee last
raised the target range.

Inflation had increased in recent quarters, with the
12-month change in the headline PCE price index rising
to nearly 2 percent in January, close to the Committee’s
longer-run objective. However, nearly all members
judged that the Committee had not yet achieved its ob-

In the view of one member, it was premature to raise the
target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.
That member preferred to await additional information
on the amount of slack remaining in the labor market
and increased evidence that inflation would stabilize at

the Committee’s objective before taking another step to
remove monetary policy accommodation.

following domestic policy directive, to be released at
2:00 p.m.:

Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size
of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions,
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Partly in light of the likelihood that the recent
higher readings on headline inflation had mostly reflected the temporary effect of increases in consumer energy prices, members agreed that the Committee would
continue to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its inflation goal. A few
members expressed the view that the Committee should
avoid policy actions or communications that might be
interpreted as suggesting that the Committee’s 2 percent
inflation objective was actually a ceiling. Several members observed that an explicit recognition in the statement that the Committee’s inflation goal was symmetric
could help support inflation expectations at a level consistent with that goal, and it was noted that a symmetric
inflation objective implied that the Committee would adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to inflation that was either persistently above or persistently below 2 percent. Members also reiterated that they expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal
funds rate. They agreed that the federal funds rate was
likely to remain, for some time, below levels expected to
prevail in the longer run. However, they noted that the
actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on
the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

“Effective March 16, 2017, the Federal Open
Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range
of ¾ to 1 percent, including overnight reverse
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase
operations with maturities of more than one day
when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.75 percent, in amounts limited only
by the value of Treasury securities held outright
in the System Open Market Account that are
available for such operations and by a percounterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee decided to maintain its existing policy of
reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over
maturing Treasury securities at auction. Members anticipated doing so until normalization of the level of the
federal funds rate was well under way. They noted that
this policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of
longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the

The Committee directs the Desk to continue
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee also directs the Desk
to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of
the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed
securities transactions.”
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
“Information received since the Federal Open
Market Committee met in February indicates
that the labor market has continued to
strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains
remained solid and the unemployment rate was
little changed in recent months. Household
spending has continued to rise moderately while
business fixed investment appears to have
firmed somewhat. Inflation has increased in recent quarters, moving close to the Committee’s
2 percent longer-run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was little changed
and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures
of longer-term inflation expectations are little
changed, on balance.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment
and price stability. The Committee expects that,

Page 12

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a
moderate pace, labor market conditions will
strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will
stabilize around 2 percent over the medium
term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook
appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators
and global economic and financial developments.
In view of realized and expected labor market
conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal
funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent. The stance of
monetary policy remains accommodative,
thereby supporting some further strengthening
in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized
and expected economic conditions relative to its
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including
measures of labor market conditions, indicators
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations,
and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully
monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in
the longer run. However, the actual path of the
federal funds rate will depend on the economic
outlook as informed by incoming data.
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy
of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgageIn taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted
by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of
Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago,
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 1½ percent primary credit rate by the remaining

securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so
until normalization of the level of the federal
funds rate is well under way. This policy, by
keeping the Committee’s holdings of longerterm securities at sizable levels, should help
maintain accommodative financial conditions.”
Voting for this action: Janet L. Yellen, William C.
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley
Fischer, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Jerome H.
Powell, and Daniel K. Tarullo.
Voting against this action: Neel Kashkari.
Mr. Kashkari dissented because he preferred to maintain
the existing target range for the federal funds rate at this
meeting. In his view, recent data had not pointed to further progress on the Committee’s dual objectives and
thus had not provided a compelling case to firm monetary policy at this meeting. He preferred to await additional information on the amount of slack remaining in
the labor market and increased evidence that inflation
would stabilize at the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent
inflation objective before taking another step to remove
monetary policy accommodation. Mr. Kashkari also
preferred that when data do support a removal of monetary policy accommodation, the FOMC first publish a
detailed plan to normalize its balance sheet before proceeding with further increases in the federal funds rate.
To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required
and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to
1 percent, effective March 16, 2017. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate (discount
rate) to 1½ percent, effective March 16, 2017. 6

and Minneapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board
of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary
credit rate of 1½ percent, effective March 16, 2017.) The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal
credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates.

Summary of Economic Projections
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on March 14–15, 2017, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most
likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to 2019
and over the longer run.1 Each participant’s projection
was based on information available at the time of the
meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy, including a path for the federal
funds rate and its longer-run value, and assumptions
about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes.
The longer-run projections represent each participant’s
assessment of the value to which each variable would be
expected to converge, over time, under appropriate
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to
the economy. 2 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant
deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual
interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of
maximum employment and stable prices.
Most FOMC participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) would run somewhat above their individual
estimates of its longer-run rate this year and in 2018,
while about half of the participants projected that economic growth would slow in 2019 and run at or slightly
below their individual longer-run estimates. A substantial majority of participants projected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longerrun normal level in 2017 and remain below that level
through 2019. A large majority of participants projected
that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption
expenditures (PCE), would increase over the next two
years; a majority of participants projected that inflation
would be at the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2019,
and all participants projected that inflation would be
within a couple of tenths of a percentage point of the
objective in that year. Participants’ economic projections were generally quite similar to those submitted in
December. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections.
The office of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta was vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; the incoming president is scheduled to assume office on June 5,
2017. Marie Gooding, First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, submitted economic projections.

1

As shown in figure 2, all but one participant expected
that the evolution of economic conditions would likely
warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to
achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. The medians of projections for the federal funds rate in 2017, 2018, and 2019 were essentially
the same as those in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). The median for 2019 was
equal to the median of the longer-run projections. However, the economic outlook is uncertain, and participants
noted that their economic projections and assessments
of appropriate monetary policy could change in response
to incoming information.
Most participants viewed the uncertainty attached to
their projections as broadly similar to the average of the
past 20 years, although some participants saw the uncertainty associated with their forecasts as higher than average. Most participants also judged the risks around their
projections for economic growth, the unemployment
rate, and inflation as broadly balanced, while several participants saw the risks to their forecasts of real GDP
growth and inflation as weighted to the upside and several participants viewed the risks to their unemployment
rate forecasts as tilted to the downside.
Figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, respectively, present for
the first time “fan charts” as well as charts of participants’ current qualitative assessments of the uncertainty
and risks surrounding their economic projections. The
fan charts (the panels at the top of these three figures)
show the medians of participants’ projections surrounded by confidence intervals that are computed from
the forecast errors of various private and government
projections made over the past 20 years. The width of
the confidence interval for each variable at a given point
provides a measure of forecast uncertainty at that horizon. For all three macroeconomic variables, these charts
illustrate that forecast uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens. Reflecting in part the uncertainty about the future evolution
of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation,
participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy
are also subject to considerable uncertainty. To illustrate
2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal
funds rate.

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are percent changes from the
fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change
in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for
the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are
based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each
variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the
federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target
level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with
the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 13–14, 2016. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in
real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 13–14, 2016, meeting, and one participant did not submit
such projections in conjunction with the March 14–15, 2017, meeting.

the uncertainty regarding the appropriate path for monetary policy, figure 5 shows a comparable fan chart
around the medians of participants’ assessments for the
federal funds rate. 3 As with the macroeconomic variables, forecast uncertainty for short-term interest rates is
substantial and increases as the horizon lengthens.
The Outlook for Economic Activity
The median of participants’ projections for the growth
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was
2.1 percent in 2017 and 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019;
the median of projections for the longer-run normal rate
of real GDP growth was 1.8 percent. Compared with
the December SEP, the medians of the forecasts for real
GDP growth over the period from 2017 to 2019, as well
as the median assessment of the longer-run growth rate,
were mostly unchanged. As in December, about half of
the participants incorporated expectations of fiscal stimulus into their projections; almost all in this group projected slightly higher real GDP growth next year relative
to their December projections.
The median of projections for the unemployment rate in
the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.5 percent, unchanged
from December and 0.2 percentage point below the median assessment of its longer-run normal level. Almost
all participants projected that the unemployment rate
would not change much over the subsequent two years.
Based on the median projections, the anticipated path of
the unemployment rate for coming years was also unchanged from the previous forecast. The median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment
was 4.7 percent, slightly lower than in December.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2017 to 2019 and in the longer run.
The distribution of individual projections of real GDP
growth for this year was less dispersed relative to the distribution of the December projections, while the distribution for 2018 shifted up slightly. The distributions of
projections for the unemployment rate were unchanged
The fan chart for the federal funds rate provides a depiction
of the uncertainty around the median assessment of the future
path of appropriate monetary policy and is closely connected
with the uncertainty about the future value of economic variables. In contrast, the dot plot shown in figure 2 displays the
dispersion of views across individual participants about the
appropriate level of the federal funds rate.
4 One participant’s projections for the federal funds rate, real
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were informed by the view that there are multiple possible medium3

for 2017 and 2018, while they shifted slightly lower for
2019 and for the longer-run normal rate.
The Outlook for Inflation
The medians of projections for headline PCE price inflation were 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2.0 percent in 2018
and 2019; these medians were unchanged from December. Only a few participants saw inflation continuing to
run below 2 percent in 2019, while several participants
projected that inflation would run modestly above the
Committee’s objective in that year. The medians of projections for core inflation were 1.9 percent in 2017 and
2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019, very similar to the contour
in December.
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation. The distributions of projections for headline
PCE price inflation were largely unchanged from December, while the distributions for core PCE price inflation shifted up slightly. Some participants attributed the
upward shift in their projections for core inflation to recent data that were somewhat above expectations.
Appropriate Monetary Policy
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’
judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint
of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end
of each year from 2017 to 2019 and over the longer run. 4
The distributions for 2017 through 2019 shifted up
modestly. The median projections of the federal funds
rate continued to show gradual increases, with the median assessment for 2017 standing at 1.38 percent, consistent with three 25 basis point rate increases this year.
Thereafter, the medians of the projections were
2.13 percent at the end of 2018 and 3.00 percent at the
end of 2019; the median of the longer-run projections of
the federal funds rate was 3.00 percent. Compared with
the December SEP, the median of the projections for
the federal funds rate rose only for 2019, and in that case
just slightly.

term regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are persistent, and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way
that cannot be forecast. Under this view, the economy currently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic
activity with low productivity growth and a low short-term real
interest rate, but longer-term outcomes for variables other
than inflation cannot be usefully projected.

NOTE: Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root
mean squared error of projections for 1997 through 2016 that were released in the spring by various private and government forecasters. As
described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions,
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the
past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip
(2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance
and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), available

1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1.
2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure
that has been most widely used in government and private economic
forecasts. Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.
3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds
rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.
Historical projections are the average level, in percent, in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated.

In discussing their March forecasts, many participants
continued to express the view that the appropriate upward trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next
few years would likely be gradual. That anticipated pace
reflected a few factors, such as a short-term neutral real
interest rate that was currently low and was expected to
move up only slowly as well as a gradual return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. A few participants indicated that positive news on inflation and
the continued strengthening of labor market conditions
in recent months had increased their confidence that inflation would move toward or to the 2 percent objective.
Some participants judged that a slightly firmer path of
monetary policy than in their previous projections would
likely be appropriate. Most of the participants who commented on the Committee’s reinvestment policy anticipated that a change in that policy would be appropriate
before the end of this year if the economic outlook
evolved as projected.
Uncertainty and Risks
The economic projections of FOMC participants are
generally subject to considerable uncertainty and risks,
At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty”
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess

and, in assessing the path of appropriate monetary policy, FOMC participants take account of the range of
possible outcomes, the likelihood of their occurring, and
the potential benefits and costs to the economy should
they occur. Table 2 provides one measure of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation—the
root mean squared error (RMSE) for forecasts made
over the past 20 years. This measure of forecast uncertainty is incorporated graphically in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C, which display fan charts plotting
the medians of participants’ projections for real GDP
growth, the unemployment rate, and PCE price inflation
surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived
from the RMSEs presented in table 2. If the degree of
uncertainty attending these projections is similar to the
typical magnitude of past forecast errors and if the risks
around the projections are broadly balanced, then future
outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 percent probability of occurring within these confidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of forecast
uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the
forecast horizon lengthens.
FOMC participants may judge that the widths of the
confidence intervals in the historical fan charts shown in
figures 4.A through 4.C do not adequately capture their
current assessments of the degree of uncertainty that
surrounds their economic projections. Participants’ assessments of the current level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projections are shown in the bottomleft panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Most participants
continued to view the uncertainty attached to their economic projections as broadly similar to the average of
the past 20 years, with one fewer participant than in December seeing uncertainty about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and headline inflation as higher than
its historical average. 5 In their discussion of the uncertainty attached to their current projections relative to levels of uncertainty over the past 20 years, as in December,
about half of the participants expressed the view that, at
this point, uncertainty surrounding prospective changes
in fiscal and other policies is very large or that there is
not yet enough information to make reasonable assumptions about the timing, nature, and magnitude of the
changes.
The fan charts—which are symmetric around the median projections by assumption—also do not necessarily
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projections.

information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed,
on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the

reflect participants’ assessments of the balance of risks
to their economic projections. Participants’ assessments
of the balance of risks to their economic projections are
shown in the bottom-right panels of figures 4.A, 4.B,
and 4.C. As in December, most participants judged the
risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as
broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent
with a symmetric fan chart. One more participant saw
the risks to unemployment as weighted to the downside
than in December (the bottom-right panel of figure 4.B).
The balance of risks to the inflation projection shifted
up slightly relative to December, as one fewer participant
judged the risks to both headline and core inflation as
weighted to the downside and one more participant
viewed the risks as weighted to the upside (the lowerright panels of figure 4.C). In discussing the balance of
risks around their projections, some participants mentioned improvements in recent readings of household
and business confidence as well as somewhat reduced
risks from abroad. Moreover, a number of participants
noted that the possibility of a more expansionary U.S.
fiscal policy might present upside risks to real GDP
growth and inflation and downside risks to unemployment.
Participants’ assessments of the future path of the federal funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are
generally subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting
in part uncertainty about the evolution of GDP growth,
the unemployment rate, and inflation over time. The fi-

nal line in table 2 shows the RMSEs for forecasts of
short-term interest rates. These RMSEs are not strictly
consistent with participants’ projections of the federal
funds rate, in part because these assessments are not
forecasts of the likeliest outcomes but rather reflect each
participant’s individual judgment of appropriate monetary policy. However, the associated confidence intervals may provide a sense of the likely uncertainty around
the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the
uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well
as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be
appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.
Figure 5 shows a fan chart plotting the medians of participants’ assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the results presented in table 2. As with the
macroeconomic variables, forecast uncertainty is substantial and increases at longer horizons. If at some
point in the future the confidence interval around the
federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would
be truncated at zero for purposes of the chart shown in
figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for
the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention and would not have any implication for possible
future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.
The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.
* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty
The economic projections provided by the members of
the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis
for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these
projections, however. The economic and statistical models
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad
unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP)
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of,
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the
past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand
within a range of 1.4 to 4.6 percent in the current year, and
0.9 to 5.1 percent in the second and third years. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, and 0.9
to 3.1 percent in the second and third years. Figures 4.A
through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan
charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of
FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances,
the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In
particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be
tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the
corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned
around the median projection.
Because current conditions may differ from those that
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is,
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather
than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable
uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that
point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges
for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections
of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted,
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of
shocks to the economy.
If at some point in the future the confidence interval
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the
Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention;
it would not have any implications for possible future policy
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so
were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset
purchases, to provide additional accommodation.
While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1
provides information on the range of views across FOMC
participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast
errors over the past 20 years.
