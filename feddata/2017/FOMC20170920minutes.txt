publication in the Federal Register of an earlier version of
the Rules.4 The amendment approved at this meeting
indicated that if, in the course of processing a Freedom
of Information Act request, “an adverse determination
is upheld on appeal, in whole or in part,” the requester
will be informed “of the availability of dispute resolution
services from the Office of Government Information
Services as a nonexclusive alternative to litigation.” This
notice will be provided in addition to the ongoing practice of informing the requester of the right to seek judicial review.
Secretary’s note: The amended Rules adopted
at this meeting were published in the Federal Register as a final rule on October 2, 2017, and will
go into effect 30 days following publication.
Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager of the System Open Market Account
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets over the period since the July
FOMC meeting. Yields on longer-term Treasury securities had fallen modestly, the foreign exchange value of
the dollar had declined, and broad equity price indexes
had increased. Survey responses suggested that the vast
majority of market participants expected the FOMC to
announce a change in SOMA reinvestment policy at this
meeting and that nearly all market participants anticipated that the FOMC would also leave the target range
for the federal funds rate unchanged.
The deputy manager followed with a report on developments in money markets and open market operations
over the intermeeting period. The effective federal
funds rate remained near the center of the FOMC’s target range except on month-ends. Take-up at the System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility averaged somewhat less than in the previous period. The
deputy manager provided updates on developments
with respect to reference interest rates and on smallvalue tests of open market operations, which are conducted routinely to promote operational readiness. The
deputy manager also summarized the results of the
staff’s annual review of foreign reserves investment and
its recommendations to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee for key parameters for foreign reserves investment for the forthcoming year, and the deputy manager

In compliance with the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the
earlier version of the Rules was published in the Federal Register
as an interim final rule on December 27, 2016.

noted that the Subcommittee would welcome any input
from the Committee regarding those parameters.
Secretary’s note: On September 27, 2017, the
Foreign Currency Subcommittee provided to
the Federal Reserve Bank selected to conduct
open market operations instructions that incorporated the staff recommendations for key parameters for foreign reserves investment.
Finally, the manager reviewed details of the operational
approach that the Open Market Desk planned to follow
if the Committee decided at this meeting to initiate the
proposal for SOMA reinvestment policy described in
the Committee’s June 2017 Addendum to the Policy
Normalization Principles and Plans.
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.
There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period.
Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the September 19–20
meeting showed that labor market conditions continued
to strengthen in July and August and that real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a moderate pace in the third quarter before the landfall of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Only limited data pertaining
to the economic effects of these hurricanes were available at the time of the meeting, but it appeared likely that
the negative effects would restrain national economic activity only in the near term. 5 Total consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the price
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE),
continued to run below 2 percent in July and was lower
than at the start of the year. Survey-based measures of
longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on
balance.
Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in July
and August, with strong gains in private-sector jobs and
declines in government employment. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.3 percent in July and edged back
up to 4.4 percent in August. The unemployment rates
for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites
were lower, on average, in recent months than around
the start of the year, whereas the unemployment rate for
Asians was a little higher. The overall labor force particThe background materials prepared by the staff for this
meeting were completed before the full effects of Hurricane
Maria were evident.

ipation rate edged up in July and was unchanged in August, and the share of workers employed part time for
economic reasons was little changed on net. The rate of
private-sector job openings increased in June and July,
the hiring rate ticked up, and the quits rate edged down.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits
jumped in early September from a very low level, and the
Department of Labor noted that Hurricane Harvey had
an effect on claims. Changes in measures of labor compensation were mixed. Compensation per hour rose just
1¼ percent over the four quarters ending in the second
quarter of 2017 (partly reflecting a significant downward
revision to compensation per hour in the second half of
2016), the employment cost index for private workers
increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in
June, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose
2½ percent over the 12 months ending in August.
Total industrial production (IP) increased for a sixth
consecutive month in July but then declined sharply in
August. The decrease in August largely reflected the
temporary effects of Hurricane Harvey on drilling, servicing, and extraction activity for oil and natural gas and
on output in several manufacturing industries that are
concentrated in the Gulf Coast region, including petroleum refining, organic chemicals, and plastics materials
and resins. Production disruptions from Hurricane Harvey continued into September, and the effects of Hurricane Irma were anticipated to hold down IP in that
month as well. Even so, anecdotal reports from the
hurricane-affected regions, as well as daily data on capacity outages in selected Gulf Coast industries, indicated
that production had already started to recover. Meanwhile, automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that
motor vehicle production would move up, on balance,
over the remainder of the year despite a somewhat elevated level of dealers’ inventories and a slowing in the
pace of vehicle sales in recent months. Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing
surveys, continued to point to moderate gains in factory
output over the near term.
Several pieces of information suggested that real PCE
was likely increasing at a slower rate in the third quarter
than in the second. First, the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE declined in August and were revised down in June and July. Second,

Page 4

the pace of light motor vehicle sales moved lower, on
net, in July and August. Third, Hurricanes Harvey and
Irma appeared likely to temporarily reduce consumer
spending. However, recent readings on key factors that
influence consumer spending—including continued
gains in employment, real disposable personal income,
and households’ net worth—remained supportive of
solid growth in real PCE. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was upbeat through early September.
Recent information on housing activity suggested that
real residential investment spending was decreasing in
the third quarter after declining in the second quarter.
Starts for new single-family homes edged down, on net,
in July and August, and starts for multifamily units
moved lower in both months. Building permit issuance
for new single-family homes—which tends to be a good
indicator of the underlying trend in construction—declined in July and August. Sales of both new and existing
homes decreased in July.
Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to be increasing at a solid
rate in the third quarter. Nominal orders and shipments
of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose over
the two months ending in July, and readings on business
sentiment remained upbeat. In contrast, investment in
nonresidential structures was poised to decline in the
third quarter. Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining fell sharply
in June and July, and the number of oil and gas rigs in
operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the
drilling and mining sector, leveled out in the past couple
of months after increasing steadily for the past year.
Total real government purchases looked to be roughly
flat, on balance, in the third quarter. Nominal outlays
for defense in July and August pointed to a small increase in real federal government purchases in the third
quarter. However, payrolls for state and local governments declined in July and August, and nominal construction spending by these governments decreased in
July.
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed
substantially in June and was about unchanged in July.
After increasing in June, exports retraced a bit of this
gain in July, with lower exports of consumer goods, automotive products, and services. Imports decreased a
little in both months. The available data suggested that
net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth
in the third quarter.

Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE
price index, increased nearly 1½ percent over the
12 months ending in July. Core PCE price inflation,
which excludes consumer food and energy prices, also
was about 1½ percent over that same period. Over the
12 months ending in August, the consumer price index
(CPI) increased almost 2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent. Retail gasoline prices moved up
sharply following the landfall of Hurricane Harvey and
appeared likely to put temporary upward pressure on the
12-month change in total PCE prices. The median of
inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from
the Michigan survey edged back up in the preliminary
reading for September, and the median expectation for
PCE price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters edged down. The medians of longer-run inflation expectations from the Desk’s
Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were relatively little changed in September.
Foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid
pace. Economic growth picked up in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) in the second quarter, especially
in Canada, and incoming indicators suggested that
growth slowed in the third quarter but remained firm.
Recent indicators from the emerging market economies
(EMEs) also pointed to continued strong economic
growth, notwithstanding some slowing in the rate of expansion of activity in China. Headline inflation in most
AFEs remained subdued, held down in part by falling
retail energy prices, but data through August suggested
that the drag from energy prices was diminishing. Inflation also remained low in most EMEs, although food
prices continued to put upward pressure on inflation in
Mexico.
Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Domestic financial market conditions remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period. U.S.
equity prices increased, longer-term Treasury yields declined, and the dollar depreciated. Investors’ interpretations of FOMC communications, market perceptions of
a reduced likelihood of U.S. fiscal policy changes, and
heightened geopolitical risks all reportedly placed downward pressure on longer-term yields. At the same time,
financing conditions for households and nonfinancial
businesses continued to provide support for growth in
spending and investment.
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period
reportedly were interpreted as indicating a somewhat
slower pace of increases in the target range for the fed-

eral funds rate than previously expected. Market participants were attentive to the Committee’s assessment of
recent below-expectations inflation data and the acknowledgment in the July FOMC minutes that inflation
might continue to run below the Committee’s 2 percent
objective for longer than anticipated. Investors also
took note of the Committee’s guidance in the July
FOMC statement that it expected to begin implementing
its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon.
By the end of the intermeeting period, market participants appeared nearly certain that the Committee would
announce the implementation of its balance sheet normalization plan at the September meeting. The probability of an increase in the target range for the federal
funds rate occurring at either the September or the November meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds
futures contracts, fell to essentially zero, while the probability of a 25 basis point increase by the end of the year
stood near 50 percent and was little changed since the
July meeting. Quotes on overnight index swaps (OIS)
pointed to a slight flattening of the expected path of the
federal funds rate through 2020, with a staff model attributing most of the declines in OIS rates to lower expected rates.
Yields on intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasury securities decreased modestly over the intermeeting
period. Treasury yields fell following the July FOMC
meeting, reflecting the response of investors to the
postmeeting statement, and then dropped further amid
rising geopolitical tensions related to North Korea and
market perceptions of reduced prospects for enactment
of a fiscal stimulus program. Economic data releases appeared to have little net effect on Treasury yields over
most of the period. A staff term structure model attributed about half of the decline in the 10-year Treasury
yield to a decrease in the average expected future shortterm rate and the remaining half to a lower term premium. Measures of inflation compensation over the
next 5 years rose modestly, on net, partly in response to
the release of higher-than-expected CPI data for August,
while inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was little changed.
Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period. One-month-ahead option-implied volatility of the S&P 500 index—the VIX—remained at historically low levels despite brief spikes associated with
increased investor concerns about geopolitical tensions
and political uncertainties. Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields on investment- and speculativegrade nonfinancial corporate bonds over those on
comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened a bit.

Short-dated Treasury bill yields were elevated for a time,
reflecting concerns about potential delays in raising the
federal debt limit. However, following news of an agreement to extend the debt ceiling by three months, rates
on Treasury bills maturing in October retraced their entire increase from early in the intermeeting period. Conditions in other domestic short-term funding markets
were stable. Yields on a broad set of money market instruments remained in the ranges observed since the
FOMC increased the target range for the federal funds
rate in June. Daily take-up at the System’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility ran somewhat lower
than in the previous intermeeting period.
Since the July FOMC meeting, asset price movements in
global financial markets were driven by geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula, improving economic prospects abroad, communications from AFE central
banks, and changes in prospects for fiscal policy legislation in the United States. The broad index of the foreign
exchange value of the dollar decreased 1½ percent; the
decline was widespread, led by the strengthening of the
euro and the Chinese renminbi. The Canadian dollar appreciated following a rate hike by the Bank of Canada at
its September meeting that came sooner than market
participants expected. Similarly, sterling appreciated after the Bank of England signaled a potential rate hike in
the coming months. Against this backdrop, longer-term
yields rose slightly in Canada and the United Kingdom.
In contrast, longer-term German yields declined moderately, despite better-than-expected economic data releases for the euro area, as market expectations shifted
toward a more gradual withdrawal of stimulus by the European Central Bank (ECB) even though the ECB kept
its policy stance unchanged.
Despite generally better-than-expected earnings releases,
AFE equity prices were mixed over the period, with
bank stocks underperforming broader indexes. Outside
South Korea, most emerging market asset prices were
little affected by the recent escalation of geopolitical concerns. Net flows to emerging market mutual funds
briefly turned negative in early August, but they quickly
returned to near the high levels seen since early this year.
Yield spreads on EME sovereign bonds edged down.
Financing conditions for U.S. nonfinancial businesses
continued to be accommodative. Issuance of corporate
debt and equity was strong in July and August. Gross
issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued its robust pace in June but slowed notably in July, as is typical
during the summer. Meanwhile, the growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books ticked up

Page 6
Federal Open Market Committee
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

in July and August compared with its pace over the first
half of the year; however, C&I loan growth from the
fourth quarter of last year through August remained significantly lower than over recent years.
Gross issuance of municipal bonds was strong in August, and spreads of yields on municipal bonds over
those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities increased a bit over the intermeeting period. The credit
quality of state and local governments improved overall,
as the number of ratings upgrades notably outpaced the
number of downgrades in August.
The growth of commercial real estate (CRE) loans on
banks’ books continued to moderate in July and August,
reflecting a slowdown in lending both for nonfarm nonresidential units and for construction and land development; nonetheless, CRE financing appeared to remain
broadly available. Issuance of commercial mortgagebacked securities (CMBS) so far this year was similar to
that in the same period a year earlier. Spreads on CMBS
over Treasury securities narrowed a little over the intermeeting period and were near the bottom of their ranges
of the past several years. Delinquency rates on loans in
CMBS pools declined slightly but remained elevated for
loans that were originated before the financial crisis.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgages
moved lower over the intermeeting period, in line with
comparable-maturity Treasury yields. Growth in mortgage lending for home purchases picked up in July and
August compared with its pace over the second quarter.
However, credit conditions remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or hard-to-document incomes.
Consumer credit continued to be readily available for
most borrowers, and overall loan balances rose at a moderate pace in the second quarter, reflecting further expansions in credit card, auto, and student loan balances.
Issuance of asset-backed securities remained robust over
the year to date and outpaced that of the previous year,
providing support for consumer lending. However,
standards and terms on auto and credit card loans were
tighter for subprime borrowers, likely in response to rising delinquencies on such loans. Subprime auto loan
balances have declined so far this year, partly reflecting
the tighter lending standards, and the average credit
score of all borrowers who obtained an auto loan in the
second quarter remained near the upper end of its range
of the past few years.
Staff Economic Outlook
The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for
the September FOMC meeting was broadly similar to

the previous forecast. Real GDP was expected to rise at
a solid pace, on net, in the second half of the year, and
by a little more than previously projected, reflecting data
on spending that were stronger than expected on balance. The short-term disruptions to spending and production associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma
were expected to reduce real GDP growth in the third
quarter and to boost it in the fourth quarter as production returned to its pre-hurricane path and as a portion
of the lost spending was made up. The hurricanes were
also expected to depress payroll employment in September, with a reversal over the next few months. Beyond
2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised.
In particular, the staff continued to project that real
GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output through 2019. The unemployment rate
was projected to decline gradually over the next couple
of years and to continue running below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. Because of continued subdued inflation readings and, given
real GDP growth, a larger-than-expected decline in the
unemployment rate over much of the past year, the staff
revised down slightly its estimate of the longer-run natural rate of unemployment in this projection.
The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as
measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised up somewhat for 2017 in response to hurricanerelated effects on gasoline prices. The near-term forecast for core PCE price inflation was essentially unrevised. Total PCE price inflation this year was expected
to run at the same pace as last year, with a slower increase
in core PCE prices offset by a slightly larger increase in
energy prices and an upturn in the prices for food and
non-energy imports. Beyond 2017, the inflation forecast
was little revised from the previous projection. The staff
continued to project that inflation would edge higher in
the next couple of years and that it would reach the
Committee’s longer-run objective in 2019.
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. On
the one hand, many financial market indicators of uncertainty remained subdued, and the uncertainty associated
with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than
last year; on the other hand, uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts
for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. The risks to the projection for inflation were also
seen as balanced. Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have

Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2017
Page 7
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

edged down or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. These downside risks were seen as essentially
counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could
increase more than expected in an economy that was
projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the
Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate,
and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2020 and
over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. 6
The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable
would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further
shocks to the economy. These projections and policy
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic
Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes.
In their discussion of the economic situation and the
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information
received over the intermeeting period indicated that the
labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this
year. Job gains had remained solid in recent months, and
the unemployment rate had stayed low. Household
spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and
growth in business fixed investment had picked up in
recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation
and the measure excluding food and energy prices had
declined this year and were running below 2 percent.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
Participants acknowledged that Hurricanes Harvey,
Irma, and Maria would affect economic activity in the
near term. They expected growth of real GDP in the
third quarter to be held down by the severe disruptions
caused by the storms but to rebound beginning in the
fourth quarter as rebuilding got under way and economic
activity in the affected areas resumed. Similarly, employment would be temporarily depressed by the hurricanes,

as in June 2017, were in office at the time of the September
2017 meeting. The office of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was vacant at the time of both

6

but, abstracting from those effects, employment gains
were anticipated to remain solid, and the unemployment
rate was expected to decline a bit further by year-end.
Based on the estimated effects of past major hurricanes
that made landfall in the United States, participants
judged that the recent storms were unlikely to materially
alter the course of the national economy over the medium term. Moreover, they generally viewed the information on spending, production, and labor market activity that became available over the intermeeting period,
which was mostly not affected by the hurricanes, as suggesting little change in the outlook for economic growth
and the labor market over the medium term. Consequently, they continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market
conditions would strengthen somewhat further. In the
aftermath of the hurricanes, higher prices for gasoline
and some other items were likely to boost inflation temporarily. Apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month
basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent
in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s
2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term
risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced, but participants agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
Consumer spending had been expanding at a moderate
rate through the summer, and reports on retail activity
from participants’ contacts were generally positive. Participants expected some fluctuations in consumer spending to result from the hurricanes, but they generally
judged that consumption growth would continue to be
supported by still-solid fundamental determinants of
household spending, including the income generated by
the ongoing strength in the labor market, improved
household balance sheets, and high levels of consumer
confidence. Sales of autos and light trucks had softened
over the summer, leading producers to slow production
to address a buildup of inventories, but a couple of participants noted that automakers expected to see a temporary increase in demand as households and businesses
replaced vehicles damaged during the storms.
Incoming data on business spending showed that equipment investment had picked up during 2017 after having
been weak during much of 2016. Shipments and orders
FOMC meetings; First Vice President Mark L. Mullinix submitted economic projections. One participant did not submit
longer-run projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.

of nondefense capital goods had been on a steady uptrend over the first eight months of 2017. A number of
participants reported that their business contacts appeared to have become more confident about the economic outlook, and it was noted that the National Federation of Independent Business reported that greater
optimism among small businesses had contributed to a
sharp increase in the proportion of small firms planning
increases in their capital expenditures. A couple of participants commented that competitive pressures and
tight labor markets were increasing the incentives for
businesses to substitute capital for labor or to invest in
information technology. In contrast, reports on the
strength of nonresidential construction were mixed.
And in energy-producing regions, the count of drilling
rigs in operation had begun to level off before the onset
of Hurricane Harvey.
Participants generally indicated that, before the recent
hurricanes, business activity in their Districts was expanding at a moderate pace. Although industrial production in areas affected by the storms was estimated to
have declined in August, a number of participants from
other areas reported further solid gains in manufacturing
activity in their Districts. Participants from the regions
affected by the hurricanes reported that businesses in
their Districts anticipated that the disruptions to business and sales would be relatively short lived. In the energy sector, Hurricane Harvey had shut down drilling
and refining activity, but by the time of the meeting,
these operations had substantially resumed. And many
business contacts in the affected areas reported that they
expected their operations to return to normal before the
end of the year. Farming in some parts of the country
had been affected by drought, and income in the agricultural sector was under downward pressure because of
low crop prices.
Overall, the available information suggested that, although the storms would likely affect the quarterly pattern of changes in real GDP at least through the second
half of the year, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate rate over the medium term, supported by further gains in consumer spending and the
pickup in business investment. In addition, improving
global economic conditions and the depreciation of the
dollar in recent months were anticipated to result in a
modest positive contribution to domestic economic activity from net exports. In contrast, most participants
had not assumed enactment of a fiscal stimulus package
in their economic projections or had marked down the
expected magnitude of any stimulus.

Labor market conditions strengthened further in recent
months. The increases in nonfarm payroll employment
in July and August remained well above the pace likely
to be sustainable in the longer run. Although the unemployment rate was little changed from March to August,
it remained below participants’ estimates of its longerrun normal level. Other indicators suggested that labor
market conditions had continued to tighten over recent
quarters. The labor force participation rate had been
moving sideways despite factors, such as demographic
changes, that were contributing to a declining longer-run
trend. In addition, the number of individuals working
part time for economic reasons, as a share of household
employment, had moved lower. The job openings rate,
the quits rate, households’ assessments of job availability, and the labor market conditions index prepared by
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had returned
to pre-recession levels. However, some participants still
saw room for further increases in labor utilization, with
a couple of them noting that the employment-topopulation ratio and the participation rate for prime-age
workers had not fully recovered to pre-recession levels.
Against the backdrop of the continued strengthening in
labor market conditions, participants discussed recent
wage developments. Increases in most aggregate
measures of hourly wages and labor compensation remained subdued, and several participants commented
that the absence of broad-based upward wage pressures
suggested that the sustainable rate of unemployment
might be lower than they currently estimated. Other factors that may have been contributing to the subdued
pace of wage increases reported in the national data included low productivity growth, changes in the composition of the workforce, and competitive pressure on
employers to hold down their costs. However, reports
from business contacts in several Districts indicated that
employers in labor markets in which demand was high
or in which workers in some occupations were in short
supply were raising wages noticeably to compete for
workers and limit turnover. It was noted that the expected increase in demand for skilled construction workers for reconstruction in hurricane-affected areas would
likely exacerbate existing shortages. Most participants
expected wage increases to pick up over time as the labor
market strengthened further; a couple of participants
cautioned that a broader acceleration in wages may already have begun, consistent with already-tight labor
market conditions.
Based on the available data, PCE price inflation over the
12 months ending in August was estimated to be about
1½ percent, remaining below the Committee’s longer-

run objective. In their review of the recent data and the
outlook for inflation, participants discussed a number of
factors that could be contributing to the low readings on
consumer prices this year and weighed the extent to
which those factors might be transitory or could prove
more persistent. Many participants continued to believe
that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market or an economy operating above its potential
were likely to show through to higher inflation over the
medium term. In addition, many judged that at least part
of the softening in inflation this year was the result of
idiosyncratic or one-time factors, and, thus, their effects
were likely to fade over time. However, other developments, such as the effects of earlier changes to government health-care programs that had been holding down
health-care costs, might continue to do so for some time.
Some participants discussed the possibility that secular
trends, such as the influence of technological innovations on competition and business pricing, also might
have been muting inflationary pressures and could be intensifying. It was noted that other advanced economies
were also experiencing low inflation, which might suggest that common global factors could be contributing
to persistence of below-target inflation in the United
States and abroad. Several participants commented on
the importance of longer-run inflation expectations to
the outlook for a return of inflation to 2 percent. A
number of indicators of inflation expectations, including
survey statistics and estimates derived from financial
market data, were generally viewed as indicating that
longer-run inflation expectations remained reasonably
stable, although a few participants saw some of these
measures as low or slipping.
Participants raised a number of important considerations about the implications of persistently low inflation
for the path of the federal funds rate over the medium
run. Several expressed concern that the persistence of
low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying
trend was running below 2 percent, risking a decline in
inflation expectations. If so, the appropriate policy path
should take into account the need to bolster inflation expectations in order to ensure that inflation returned to
2 percent and to prevent erosion in the credibility of the
Committee’s objective. It was also noted that the persistence of low inflation might result in the federal funds
rate staying uncomfortably close to its effective lower
bound. However, a few others pointed out the need to
consider the lags in the response of inflation to tightening resource utilization and, thus, increasing upside risks
to inflation as the labor market tightened further.

On balance, participants continued to forecast that PCE
price inflation would stabilize around the Committee’s
2 percent objective over the medium term. However,
several noted that in preparing their projections for this
meeting, they had taken on board the likelihood that
convergence to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent
inflation objective might take somewhat longer than
they anticipated earlier. Participants generally agreed it
would be important to monitor inflation developments
closely. Several of them noted that interpreting the next
few inflation reports would likely be complicated by the
temporary run-up in energy costs and in the prices of
other items affected by storm-related disruptions and rebuilding.
In financial markets, longer-term interest rates and the
foreign exchange value of the dollar declined over the
intermeeting period, and equity prices increased. It was
noted that U.S. financial conditions recently appeared to
be responding as much or more to economic and financial news from abroad as to domestic developments.
Many participants viewed accommodative financial conditions, which had prevailed even as the Committee
raised the federal funds rate, as likely to provide support
for the economic expansion. However, a couple of
those participants expressed concern that the persistence of highly accommodative financial conditions
could, over time, pose risks to financial stability. In contrast, a few participants cautioned that these financial
market conditions might not deliver much impetus to
aggregate demand if they instead reflected a more pessimistic assessment of prospects for longer-run economic
growth and, accordingly, a view that the longer-run neutral rate of interest in the United States would remain
low.
In their discussion of monetary policy, all participants
agreed that the economy had evolved broadly as they
had anticipated at the time of the June meeting and that
the incoming data had not materially altered the medium-term economic outlook. Consistent with those assessments, participants saw it as appropriate, at this
meeting, to announce implementation of the plan for reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings that the
Committee released in June. Many underscored that the
reduction in securities holdings would be gradual and
that financial market participants appeared to have a
clear understanding of the Committee’s planned approach for a gradual normalization of the size of the
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Consequently, participants generally expected that any reaction in financial
markets to the start of balance sheet normalization
would likely be limited.

Page 10

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

With the medium-term outlook little changed, inflation
below 2 percent, and the neutral rate of interest estimated to be quite low, all participants thought it would
be appropriate for the Committee to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and nearly all supported again indicating in the
postmeeting statement that a gradual approach to increasing the federal funds rate will likely be warranted.
Nevertheless, many participants expressed concern that
the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only
transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent, and it was noted
that some patience in removing policy accommodation
while assessing trends in inflation was warranted. A few
of these participants thought that no further increases in
the federal funds rate were called for in the near term or
that the upward trajectory of the federal funds rate might
appropriately be quite shallow. Some other participants,
however, were more worried about upside risks to inflation arising from a labor market that had already reached
full employment and was projected to tighten further.
Their concerns were heightened by the apparent easing
in financial conditions that had developed since the
Committee’s policy normalization process was initiated
in December 2015. These participants cautioned that an
unduly slow pace in removing policy accommodation
could result in an overshoot of the Committee’s inflation
objective in the medium term that would likely be costly
to reverse or could lead to an intensification of financial
stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove
difficult to unwind.
Consistent with the expectation that a gradual rise in the
federal funds rate would be appropriate, many participants thought that another increase in the target range
later this year was likely to be warranted if the mediumterm outlook remained broadly unchanged. Several others noted that, in light of the uncertainty around their
outlook for inflation, their decision on whether to take
such a policy action would depend importantly on
whether the economic data in coming months increased
their confidence that inflation was moving up toward the
Committee’s objective. A few participants thought that
additional increases in the federal funds rate should be
deferred until incoming information confirmed that the
low readings on inflation this year were not likely to persist and that inflation was clearly on a path toward the
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. All agreed that they would closely monitor
and assess incoming data before making any further adjustment to the federal funds rate.

Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period
ahead, members judged that information received since
the Committee met in July indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year. Job
gains had remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low. Household spending
had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in
business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the
measure excluding food and energy prices had declined
this year and were running below 2 percent. Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained
low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
Members noted that Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria had devastated many communities, inflicting severe
hardship. Members judged that storm-related disruptions and rebuilding would affect economic activity in
the near term, but past experience suggested that the
hurricanes were unlikely to materially alter the course of
the national economy over the medium term. Consequently, the Committee continued to expect that, with
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy,
economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and
labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat
further. Higher prices for gasoline and some other items
in the aftermath of the hurricanes would likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a
12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the
Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
Members saw near-term risks to the economic outlook
as roughly balanced, but they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
After assessing current conditions and the outlook for
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal
funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent. They noted that the
stance of monetary policy remained accommodative,
thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor
market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate
would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. They expected that economic conditions would

Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2017
Page 11
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases
in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate
was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that
were expected to prevail in the longer run. Members
also again stated that the actual path of the federal funds
rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed
by incoming data. In particular, they reaffirmed that
they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal. Some members emphasized that, in
considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate, they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings
on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again
on a trajectory consistent with achieving the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.
Members agreed that, in October, the Committee would
initiate the balance sheet normalization program described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. Several members observed that, in part because financial market participants
appeared to have a clear understanding of the Committee’s plan for gradually reducing the Federal Reserve’s
securities holdings, any reaction in financial markets to
the announcement and implementation of the program
would likely be limited.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the
following domestic policy directive, to be released at
2:00 p.m.:
“Effective September 21, 2017, the Federal
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to
undertake open market operations as necessary
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target
range of 1 to 1¼ percent, including overnight
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more
than one day when necessary to accommodate
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.00 percent, in
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury
securities held outright in the System Open
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of
$30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue
rolling over at auction Treasury securities ma-

turing during September, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities
the principal payments received through September from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.
Effective in October 2017, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction the
amount of principal payments from the Federal
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds
$6 billion, and to reinvest in agency mortgagebacked securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that
exceeds $4 billion. Small deviations from these
amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities
transactions.”
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
“Information received since the Federal Open
Market Committee met in July indicates that the
labor market has continued to strengthen and
that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains have remained

inflation and the measure excluding food and
energy prices have declined this year and are
running below 2 percent.
Market-based
measures of inflation compensation remain low;
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation
expectations are little changed, on balance.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment
and price stability. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,
and Maria have devastated many communities,
inflicting severe hardship. Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially

of inflation pressures and inflation expectations,
and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully
monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.

federal funds rate will depend on the economic
outlook as informed by incoming data.

Voting for this action: Janet L. Yellen, William C.
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley
Fischer, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel
Kashkari, and Jerome H. Powell.
Voting against this action: None.
Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1¼ percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount
rate) at the existing level of 1¾ percent. 7
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 31–
November 1, 2017.

Summary of Economic Projections
In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 19–20, 2017,
meeting participants submitted their projections of the
most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 to
2020 and over the longer run. 1 Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time
of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of
appropriate monetary policy—including a path for the
federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic
outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each
participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under
appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. 2 “Appropriate monetary
policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her
individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
All participants who submitted longer-run projections
expected that, under appropriate monetary policy,
growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) this year
would run somewhat above their individual estimates of
its longer-run rate. Almost all participants projected that
economic growth would moderate over the next three
years, and almost all projected that real GDP growth in
2019 and 2020 would be at or close to their individual
estimates of the economy’s longer-run potential growth
rate. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that the unemployment rate would run
below their estimates of its longer-run normal level in
2017, and almost all projected that the unemployment
rate would remain below their estimates of its longer-run
level through 2020. All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change
in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would run below 2 percent in 2017 and
Four members of the Board of Governors, the same number
as in June 2017, were in office at the time of the September
2017 meeting. As in June 2017, the office of the president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was vacant at the time
of this FOMC meeting; First Vice President Mark L. Mullinix
again submitted economic projections.
2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal
funds rate. This participant’s projections over the next several
years were informed by the view that the U.S. economy is
1

then step up in the next three years; about half of them
projected that inflation would be at the Committee’s
2 percent objective in 2019 and 2020, and all judged that
inflation would be within a couple of tenths of a percentage point of the objective in those years. Most participants commented on the effects of Hurricanes Harvey
and Irma and judged that there would likely be some effect on national economic activity and inflation in the
near term but little effect in the medium term. 3 Table 1
and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections.
As shown in figure 2, participants generally expected
that evolving economic conditions would likely warrant
further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to
achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Although some participants lowered their
federal funds rate projections since June, the median
projections for the federal funds rate in 2017 and 2018
were unchanged; the median projection for 2019 was
slightly lower, and the median projection for the longerrun normal level of the federal funds rate edged down.
However, because of considerable uncertainty about
how the economy will evolve, the actual path of shortterm interest rates, including the federal funds rate, can
differ substantially from projections.
In general, participants viewed the uncertainty attached
to their economic projections as broadly similar to the
average of the past 20 years, and all participants saw the
uncertainty associated with their forecasts for real GDP
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as unchanged from June. Most participants judged the risks
around their projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly balanced.
The Outlook for Economic Activity
The median of participants’ projections for the growth
rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was
2.4 percent in 2017, about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019,
characterized by multiple medium-term regimes, that these regimes are persistent, and that optimal monetary policy is regime dependent. Because switches between regimes are difficult to predict and affect the longer-run outlook, this participant’s forecast did not incorporate convergence to longerterm outcomes for variables other than inflation.

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are percent changes from the fourth quarter of the previous
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption
expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s
assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections
for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal
funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on
June 13–14, 2017. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the June
13–14, 2017, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the September 19–20, 2017, meeting.

real GDP growth for 2017 was a bit higher, while the
medians for 2018 and 2019, as well as the median assessment of the longer-run growth rate, were mostly unchanged. Most participants did not incorporate expectations of fiscal stimulus in their projections. Several
participants who included some fiscal stimulus indicated
that they had marked down its expected magnitude relative to their June projections.
The median of projections for the unemployment rate in
the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.3 percent, unchanged
from June and 0.3 percentage point below the median
assessment of its longer-run normal level. The medians
of the unemployment rate projections for 2018 through
2020 were a little above 4 percent. The median estimate
of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was
4.6 percent, unchanged from June.
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate from 2017 to 2020 and in the longer run.
The distribution of individual projections for real GDP
growth for this year shifted up, with half of the participants now expecting real GDP growth of 2.4 or 2.5 percent and none seeing it below 2.2 percent. The distribution of projected real GDP growth in 2018 also shifted
up a bit, while the distributions in 2019 and in the longer
run were broadly similar to the distributions of the June
projections. The distributions of individual projections
for the unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019 shifted
down slightly.
The Outlook for Inflation
The median of projections for headline PCE inflation
was 1.6 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and
2 percent in 2019 and 2020, about unchanged from June.
Most participants anticipated that inflation would continue to run slightly below 2 percent in 2018, while no
participants expected inflation above 2 percent in that
year. About half projected that inflation would be equal
to the Committee’s objective in 2019 and 2020; others
projected that inflation would run a little above or below
the Committee’s objective in one or both of those years.
The median of projections for core PCE inflation was
1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.9 percent in 2018, a decline of
0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point from
June, respectively. The median projection for core PCE
inflation in 2019 and 2020 was 2.0 percent.

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation. The distributions of projections for headline
PCE inflation and for core PCE inflation in 2017 moved
down somewhat from June, and the distributions for
both measures in 2018 shifted down slightly. Most participants indicated that the soft readings on inflation so
far this year were a factor contributing to the revisions
in their inflation forecasts.
Appropriate Monetary Policy
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’
judgments regarding the appropriate target or midpoint
of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end
of each year from 2017 to 2020 and over the longer run.
The distributions for 2017 and 2018 became somewhat
less dispersed compared with those in June. Even
though the range of the distribution in 2019 was narrower than in June, other measures of dispersion were
roughly unchanged. The median projections of the federal funds rate continued to show gradual increases, with
the median assessment for 2017 standing at 1.38 percent, consistent with three 25 basis point increases this
year. Thereafter, the medians of the projections were
2.13 percent at the end of 2018, 2.69 percent at the end
of 2019, and 2.88 percent at the end of 2020. Compared
with their projections prepared for the June SEP, some
participants reduced their projection for the federal
funds rate in the longer run; the median declined
0.25 percentage point, to 2.75 percent.
In discussing their September projections, many participants again expressed the view that the appropriate upward trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next
few years would likely be gradual. That anticipated pace
reflected a few factors, including a neutral real interest
rate that was currently low and was expected to move up
only slowly as well as a gradual return of inflation to the
Committee’s 2 percent objective. Some participants
judged that a slightly lower path of the federal funds rate
than in their previous projections would likely be appropriate, with a few citing a slower rate of progress toward
the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective than previously expected or reduced prospects for fiscal stimulus. In their discussions of appropriate monetary policy,
some of the participants mentioned their assumptions
for the Committee’s reinvestment policy; all of those
who did so anticipated that the Committee would begin
its program of balance sheet normalization, described in
the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles
and Plans released in June, before the end of this year.

NOTE: Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root
mean squared error of projections for 1997 through 2016 that were released in the fall by various private and government forecasters. As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions,
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP,
unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in
ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past.
For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017),
“Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical
Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, February), www.federalreserve.gov/
econresdata/feds/2017/files/2017020pap.pdf.
1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1.
2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure
that has been most widely used in government and private economic
forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth
quarter basis.
3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds
rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.
Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the
fourth quarter.

Uncertainty and Risks
The future outcomes of economic variables are subject
to considerable uncertainty. In assessing the path of
monetary policy that, in their view, is likely to be most
appropriate, FOMC participants take account of the
range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of
those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs
should they occur. Table 2 provides one measure of
forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation—
the root mean squared error (RMSE) from forecast errors of various private and government projections
made over the past 20 years. This measure of forecast
uncertainty is incorporated graphically in the top panels
of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C, which display “fan charts”
plotting the median SEP projections for the three variables surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the RMSEs presented in table 2. The width
of the confidence interval for each variable at a given
point is a measure of forecast uncertainty at that horizon.
If the degree of uncertainty attending these projections
is similar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors

At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty”
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess

4

and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, future outcomes of these variables would have
about a 70 percent probability of occurring within these
confidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of forecast uncertainty is substantial and generally
increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.
FOMC participants may judge that the width of the historical fan charts shown in figures 4.A through 4.C does
not adequately capture their current assessments of the
degree of uncertainty that surrounds their economic
projections. Participants’ assessments of the current
level of uncertainty surrounding their economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A,
4.B, and 4.C. All or nearly all participants viewed the
degree of uncertainty attached to their economic projections about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and
inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past
20 years, and all participants saw the degree of uncertainty as unchanged from June. 4 In their discussion of
the uncertainty attached to their current projections, a
few participants judged that near-term uncertainty for
economic activity and inflation had increased as a result
of the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma but commented that their assessment of medium-term prospects
was unaffected.
The fan charts, which are constructed so as to be symmetric around the median projections, also may not fully
reflect participants’ current assessments of the balance
of risks to their economic projections. Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their economic projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of figures
4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. As in June, most participants judged
the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the
unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly
consistent with a symmetric fan chart. One fewer participant than in June judged the risks to GDP growth as
weighted to the upside, and one fewer participant judged
the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the
downside. Also, one fewer participant judged the risks
to inflation to be weighted to the upside, and one more
viewed the risks as weighted to the downside.
Participants’ assessments of the future path of the federal funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are also
subject to considerable uncertainty, reflecting in part uncertainty about the evolution of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation over time. The final line
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projections.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter
of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is
based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more
information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed,
on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the
historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around
their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who
judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view
the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of
the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly
balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of
uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) from the fourth quarter of the previous
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed
to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the
previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from
those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated
on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty
and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking,
participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past
20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their
assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections
as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For
definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box “Forecast Uncertainty.”

in table 2 shows the RMSEs for forecasts of short-term
interest rates. These RMSEs are not strictly consistent
with the SEP projections for the federal funds rate, in
part because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the
most likely outcomes but rather reflect each participant’s
individual assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
However, the associated confidence intervals provide a
sense of the likely uncertainty around the future path of
the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about
the macroeconomic variables and additional adjust-

ments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. To illustrate
the uncertainty regarding the appropriate path for monetary policy, figure 5 shows a fan chart plotting the median SEP projections for the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the results
presented in table 2. As with the macroeconomic variables, forecast uncertainty is substantial and increases at
longer horizons.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.
The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.
* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty
The economic projections provided by the members of
the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis
for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these
projections, however. The economic and statistical models
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad
unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP)
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of,
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the
past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand
within a range of 1.8 to 4.2 percent in the current year, 1.1 to
4.9 percent in the second year, 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the third
year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 0.9 to
3.1 percent in the second year, 0.8 to 3.2 percent in the third
year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A
through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan
charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of
FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances,
the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In
particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be
tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the
corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned
around the median projection.
Because current conditions may differ from those that
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur-

rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is,
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather
than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable
uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that
point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges
for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections
of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted,
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an
end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the
federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to
monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.
If at some point in the future the confidence interval
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the
Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention;
it would not have any implications for possible future policy
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so
were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset
purchases, to provide additional accommodation.
While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1
provides information on the range of views across FOMC
participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast
errors over the past 20 years.
